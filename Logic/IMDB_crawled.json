            "The family of a left-wing journalist is torn apart after the military coup of Turkey in 1980.",
            "Sadik is one of the rebellious youth who has been politically active as a university student and became a left-wing journalist in the 70&#39;s, despite his father&#39;s expectations of him becoming an agricultural engineer and taking control of their family farm in an Aegean village. On the dawn of September 12, 1980, when a merciless military coup hits the country, they cannot find access to any hospital or a doctor and his wife dies while giving birth to their only child, Deniz. After a long-lasting period of torture, trials, and jail time, Sadik returns to his village with 7-8 years old Deniz, knowing that it will be hard to correct things with his father, Huseyin."

                "I'm gradually becoming less and less surprised when I see a foreign film that's every bit as good as those produced by Americans or the Brits. This was my first Turkish film, and for those of you struggling to find it, I would direct you to Youtube where you can find it in it's entirety with English subtitles. As the translated title suggests, the story is about a man struggling to come to terms with a father who disowned him, and his feelings of growing away from his own seven year old son. The back story of Sadik's (Fikret Kuskan) personal history does not fully come to light until well into the picture, when we learn that he became an anarchist journalist, much to the dismay of his father, who had designs for his son to take over the family farm upon attaining an agricultural degree. For viewers with a Turkish background, the conflict that resulted in Sadik's jail time and torture will probably be understood better within the context of that country's history, so for someone like myself, a lot of that perspective is lost. However that doesn't affect the impact of the story when it's finally revealed that Sadik's reconciliation with his father occurred because of his impending death due to a pulmonary edema condition. The man did a noble thing for his own son Deniz (Ege Tanman) by returning him to the village of Sadik's childhood to remain with family and friends. I would challenge the viewer to maintain a dry eye as the mystery of father/grandfather Huseyin's (\u00c7etin Tekindor) 'secret room' reveals Sadim's happy and hopeful youth before he left his family. One comes away from the film with a serene sense of family bond that transcends nationality, as in the end, we are all humans subject to the same emotions of love and loyalty.",

                "A masterpiece that must be seen by everyone!It's the better film I have seen so far. It's not only about the relationships between fathers and sons, or the sequences from a coup d' etat, especially against leftist people. There are a lot of things and ideas included. For example the attitude of a former lover, wounded, married to another man, but still carrying. Its an insight to the human relationships as a whole, the role of the family in Mediterranean countries. This does not mean that people from the North for example will not understand or will not be moved. But the situations depicted, fit especially to Turks, or Greeks (like me), or perhaps Italians. The director is really one of the highest class. I had previously watched his later film Issiz Adam (Always alone), and I was so impressed that I looked for another of his movies, so I found this film. I found very good the actor who played the young boy. I was really shocked from the scene of the father regretting for his behavior, it looked very much like a Greek ancient tragedy. Also the music of the film was excellent. Everyone must see this film. Not only he will like it, but I am sure that he will be moved.",

I must admit that before watching this masterpiece I was a bit skeptical about it being a drama because most dramas I have seen evolve around irrelevant topics - but this movie will change the way you think.The story is so heartwarming and real that it will move you far beyond anything you have probably ever experienced before. The actors do such an amazing job that you will sympathize with them and might indulge in some crying even if you are a male.Even if you don't cry this movie will touch you and will make you think about your own life.Movies that are able to and make you REFLECT and THINK about yourself, for my taste, are part of the best movies of all time because their messages are delivered in a way so that you will never forget them.Go see this movie and vote because this is not only the best Turkish movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made.",

                "The movie starts on the days of military government, which started Sep.12th, 1980, and lasted 3 years (Effects of this action against democracy lasted more than 15 years). A young socialist newspaper writer (Fikret Kuskan) loses his wife on birth of his only son on the very first day of the military action, because he can not find any help for delivery of the child. After 6 years past, the father was desperate to find any jobs on the papers, which are now supporters of the new order, and decides to return his father (\u00c7etin Tekindor)'s home in a small village near Izmir: A house that he has left years ago fighting his father's wills to make him a person that his father would like him to be.I can not even summarize the rest of the movie, since one should see the movie himself/herself to understand the encounters of two strangers, father and son. One should notice the mother (Humeyra)'s role on the relationship (or non-relationship) of these two different men, and the grandson (Ege Tanman).If you have a Mediterrenean blood, Greek, Italian, whatever, you will find many things in this movie.

Hospitality, love, grief, laughs... Everything is included in this movie. An emotional breakthrough.

Every person I know who had the chance to watch this wonderful movie have cried -especially during the second half.. I applause everyone involved in the production of this magnificent piece of work.. Really brilliant work, presenting some top-notch performances (esp by Humeyra and Cetin Tekindor) and a clever collection of spectacular moments. No special effects, no superhuman strengths no fantastic landscapes.. Just human and the ordinary feelings. I felt some rush to call my mom and dad just after the movie to be sure that they are OK and to make them know once again that I really care about them. This movie makes you think deeper on values that make us human and also etches itself irreversibly to your memory by touching the deepest possible regions of your soul.. Highly recommended; a must-see! Do not forget your tissue papers because you probably will not be able to keep your tears from flowing...Thanks Cagan Irmak, and continue to blow our minds away..",

                "This movie came out in Turkey late 2005, without much advertising. It's a small family drama, set largely in western rural turkey in 1987. Within a couple of weeks, the film became a smash hit solely through word-of-mouth. Since then, it has received every national award and has become the third-biggest grossing film of the country's history by mid-March (it could go even higher, considering it's still playing in theaters after several months). It is indeed a good movie, but i doubt it'll reach the same kind of wide audiences outside the country. It's well-written, well-acted and well-shot; but some of the jokes, and especially the local accent that adds the movie a lot of its charm will be lost on international audiences i'm afraid. Similarly, the film doesn't give much information about the political events that unfold in the background. I think one of the reasons the film did so well is that it reflects the atmosphere of the older Turkish films, from the industry's heyday in the sixties. Its mixture of comedy and tearjerker melodrama catches a very subtle balance. Granted, the melodrama bits are rather manipulative, but effective nonetheless. I heard that a tissue company did a campaign where they distributed tissues to the ingoing audiences, don't know if it's true though. My one (small) problem with the film is a few anachronistic details, but i guess they wouldn't even be noticed by someone who wasn't around then and there. If you come across this movie at a local festival or some other way (not very likely, but anyway), give it a shot. It's worth watching just to see the little kid in the leading role.",

I have always despised the entertainment industry, most of all the Film industry, at the back of my mind, though I fancy a career there. I have always thought that half the money that goes into movie production or theatres or things like that could feed so many people out there or give them a job, get a living for them.If someone's going to bring to the screen a movie like Babam ve Oglum, I'd never ever utter a single word against the industry. You won't believe that one movie can affect you so much for the moment that you, even if you haven't cried since 5th grade, would be overwhelmed so much that you'd cry more than the characters on screen. Especially when you watch it alone, without anyone to distract you from the scenes. I have never felt the urge to cry for a long time. This movie reminded me of a lot of things that were hidden in me, that I strongly urge everyone who has had even a glance of this page to watch it at any cost.

NO other BGM I have heard has ever got even close to this. . Out of this World.Finally, Coming to the story, this movie is about a father, who, after the loss of his wife, takes his little son back to his hometown (from where he had run away, defying his dad) because he suffers from a lung disorder. He wants to ensure that his child has a home when he's gone, and decides to confront his father and tell him about his condition and reconcile one final time before the final goodbye.

                "A huge hit on its first release in 2005, BABAM VE O\u011eLUM (MY FATHER AND MY SON) is an unabashed melodrama with the emphasis on excess.The story is a straightforward one: Sad\u0131k (Fikret Ku\u015fkan) has to deliver his first child alone, when there is no one to take his wife Aysun (Tuba B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00fcst\u00fcn) to the hospital. The wife dies, leaving Sad\u0131k a single parent on the first day of the military coup taking place in the Republic of Turkey on 12 September 1980.Time passes: Sad\u0131k is imprisoned and tortured for his political views; but on his release, he leaves \u0130stanbul with his son Deniz (Ege Tanman) to return to the family home near \u0130zmir. He receives a frosty welcome from his father H\u00fcseyin (\u00c7etin Tekindor) who has never forgiven Sad\u0131k for quitting his studies in agriculture in \u0130stanbul and turning to politics instead. The rest of the movie focuses on the way familial relationships change, as well as how people cope with an unexpected tragedy.Director \u00c7a\u011fan Irmak looks at the oppressive influence of the past on the present; not only does it affect relationships between Sad\u0131k and H\u00fcseyin, but it significantly dictated Sad\u0131k's love-life too. Returning to his home-town, Sad\u0131k is at once attracted and repelled by its familiarity; those who have never left - even for a short time - remain blinkered in their world-views. On the other hand BABAM VE O\u011eLUM shows how families stick together in times of crisis, and can resolve their own problems so long as they are prepared to acknowledge them in the first place.The narrative contrasts Sad\u0131k's story with Deniz's imaginative fantasies, in which the little boy positions himself as the hero. In the first part of the film they can be read as a retreat from reality, as Deniz tries to cope with the trauma of moving to a new town and coping with a new life. By the end, however, he has discovered that such fantasies might change, once he grows up. They will remain fantasies, but they will fulfill a different function in his life.The film is full of major scenes of confrontation and reconciliation, with Irmak's camera-work designed to achieve maximum dramatic effect through the use of close-ups, panning shots, dissolves, and two- shots, complemented by a florid musical score (by Evanthia Reboutsika). Although the narrative celebrates excess - of emotion, of feeling and of reconciliation - it does not seem in any way forced. In fact, it is as convincing and emotion-provoking as the best Ye\u015fil\u00e7am melodramas of the past. Clearly Irmak planned BABAM VE O\u011eLUM as an homage to the genre, and he accomplishes his task with \u00e9lan. Definitely worth more than one viewing.",

I think it's due to the way Cagan Irmak (writer and director) cleverly and carefully blends everything. The movie is definitely not like a Hollywood production, maybe more like a European film. The film has many enjoyable moments but it's mainly emotional. The actings are magnificent, the story is heart-breaking and the places are so real. All performances were remarkable, but I should say I was over impressed by Cetin Tekindor's (Huseyin Aga) acting. While the bitter truths about life and family relations are portrayed perfectly, the movie also reflects life from the innocent eyes of a child. Personally, the local rural village life took me back to my some good memories. There is no need to tell what happens in the film as enough is said in the plot summary. More would only spoil it.

While it is not as amazing or as stunning as many reviews proclaim it is still a very good movie. It is prone to sentimentality sometimes, but that is more of a cultural thing. While acting wasn't spot on in a couple of places, mostly everybody has done a very good job and though it may appear that the actors are overacting you have to keep in mind that different cultures have different norms and different ways of expressing emotions.\"My Father and My Son\" is not groundbreaking, but It is both touching and humorous without falling in too many clich\u00e9s.

This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the &#39;following&#39; day, he discovers that it&#39;s Groundhog Day again, and again, and again.

The only noticeable upside is his attractive and good-natured producer. But the real nightmare begins when Phil ends up reliving the same day (Groundhog Day) over, and over again.

Phil wants to get in and out of Punxsutawney as quickly as possible, but a snowstorm forces the threesome to stay an extra night in town after the Groundhog Day festivities. When Phil awakens the next morning, he is experiencing what he thinks is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In reality, he is experiencing that Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney all over again. The same happens the following day and the following. As Phil relives that same Groundhog Day over and over again, he goes through a myriad of highs and lows. But as he comes to the realization that Groundhog Day may be his fate for eternity, he also comes to other realizations, such as that his actions have no long term consequences, but that knowledge, especially as it relates to Rita, can be a powerful and dangerous thing. But he is given opportunity after opportunity to get the day &quot;right.&quot;"

        "synopsis": "On February 1, self-centered and sour TV meteorologist Phil Connors (\nBill Murray\n), news producer Rita Hanson (\nAndie MacDowell\n) and cameraman Larry (\nChris Elliott\n) from fictional Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV9 travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities with Punxsutawney Phil, the Groundhog. Having grown tired of this assignment, Phil begrudgingly gives his Groundhog Day report the next day (February 2) during the festival and parade.\nAfter the celebration concludes, a blizzard develops that Connors had predicted would miss them, closing the roads and shutting down long-distance phone services, forcing the team to return to Punxsutawney. However, Connors awakens the next morning to find it is February 2 again, and his day unfolds in almost exactly the same way. Connors can change his behavior, but other people do and say the same things they did and said the previous day, unless Connors changes something. He is aware of the repetition, but everyone else seems to be living February 2 for the first time. This recursion repeats the following morning and the one after that, and over and over again. For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast. His clock radio is always playing the same song, \"I Got You Babe\" by Sonny & Cher. His memories of the \"previous\" day are intact, but he is trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small town.\nAfter briefly trying to rationalize his situation, and then thinking he is insane, Connors takes advantage of learning the day's events and the information he is able to gather about the town's inhabitants, and finds that his actions have no long-term consequences for himself. He revels in this situation for a time: seducing beautiful women, stealing money, even driving drunk and experiencing a police chase. However, his attempts to seduce his producer, Rita, are met with repeated failures. He begins to tire of, and then dread, his existence, starting the day by smashing the alarm clock and professing the inanity of Groundhog Day as a holiday in his newscast. In a vain attempt to break the cycle, he kidnaps Phil the Groundhog. After a police pursuit, Connors drives a stolen truck into a quarry, causing both man and rodent to die in a fiery explosion; but the loop does not stop. He commits suicide several more times. He electrocutes himself, lets a truck hit him on the road, and jumps from a tall building (other attempts are alluded to) but mere death cannot stop the day from repeating. After he dies, he simply wakes up listening to Sonny & Cher in the same bed, on the same day, over and over again.\nHe initially tries to seduce Rita by learning as much as he can on a daily basis. First he asks what she wants in a man: someone who is humble, kind, generous, courageous and sensitive; someone who likes children; someone who loves his mother and plays a musical instrument. He learns what she likes (rocky road ice cream, sweet vermouth, French poetry) and what she doesn't like (white chocolate) and pretends to share her tastes. This also fails consistently; in scene after scene, Rita slaps him before the night is over. However, he is able to befriend her in a more sincere fashion. He tells her of his circumstances -- how he is reliving the day over and over again -- and manages to convince her of the truth with his extensive knowledge of events to come, the lives of the Punxsutawney townspeople, and Rita herself.\nHe opens his heart to Rita, and her advice helps him to gradually find a goal for his trapped life: as a benefactor to others. He cannot, in a single day, bring others to fulfill his needs but he can achieve self-improvement by educating himself on a daily basis. After seeing an elderly homeless man die, Connors vows that no one will die on \"his\" day and performs many heroic services each and every repeating day, including performing the Heimlich maneuver on a choking man and saving a little boy who falls from a tree. However, he becomes despondent at being unable to save the homeless man, despite trying to get him medical care. When he demands to see the man's medical chart, a nurse tells him \"sometimes people just die.\" Connors replies \"Not today,\" but he never manages to prevent it.\nThough the film does not specify the number of repetitions, there is enough time for Connors to learn many complex skills, such as how to play jazz piano, speak French, sculpt ice, and memorize the life story of almost everyone in town. He also masters the art of flipping playing cards into an upturned hat, which he offhandedly suggests takes six months.\n(According to\nDanny Rubin\n, who shares screenwriting credit with the director, the intent in the original script was for the time-frame of Connors' repeating days to be ambiguous, but longer than a single lifetime. The studio objected to this, asking that it be reduced to two weeks. Director\nHarold Ramis\ntried to leave the time-frame loop ambiguous as how many times Connors relives February 2, but it is strongly speculated by Connors (and the viewers) to be at least 10 years.)\nEventually, Phil sees his own shadow, so to speak, and changes from an inconsiderate, callous egocentric into a thoughtful, kindhearted philanthropist, refining his understanding of human decency, which, in return, makes him an appreciated and beloved man in the town. Phil is able to befriend almost everyone he meets during the day, using his experiences to save lives and help the townspeople. In the process, he gets closer to Rita. He crafts a report on the Groundhog Day celebration so eloquent that all the other stations turn their microphones to him. After the big Groundhog Day evening dance, Rita and Phil retire together to Phil's room. They believe that if Rita is there, the cycle may be interrupted. He wakes the next morning in bed with Rita (they are both still fully clothed) and finds the time loop is broken; it is now February 3. Phil is a different person than he was on February 1 and, after going outside, Phil and Rita talk about living in Punxsutawney together. Connors suggests: \"We'll rent to start.\"\nThe closing song is \"Almost Like Being in Love\" from Brigadoon, a musical which also dealt with a village trapped in time.",

                "This movie is so charming. It starts out with Phil Connor, the Bill Murray character, doing his Bill Murray. Cynicism emanating from every pore. He is harsh, disinterested, angry, full of angst. Making jokes about everything. Everybody knows it. Everybody feels it. When the \"gift\" or \"curse\" comes to him to relive the same day over and over, he at first is confused, then flippant, then angry, then suicidal, and, finally, sees it as a chance to reclaim his humanity. This is done in a series of repetitious acts which ultimately lead to his willingness to sacrifice himself, live for the day, and try to show that he is worth saving. What this movie does, like \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" is ask us what we would do, given the same circumstances. Would we fall into a retreat of depression? Would we become something that we always wanted to be? Would we keep living it the same way, hoping for he best? Murray's character wants the romance and the commitment that he was never willing to give. He toys with his own approach to the world, experimenting and doing things until he gets them right. He goes through a period of embracing the bad, lusting after Andy MacDowell, forcing himself on the other women in the town, disdaining the \"characters\" he meets. But like most \"everymen,\" he eventually must become good because without that, it doesn't matter anymore.He can only impress so much; he can only be angry so long. I find this movie so intriguing, not for what it says but for what it teaches. Some don't like the ending, but whatever the forces are that bring it about, it has to be. If we accept that premise, it's OK.",

                "Even the funniest movies eventually stop making me laugh after I've watched them enough times that the humor no longer surprises me. A joke never has the same effect when you know the punch line in advance. But every once in a blue moon, a comedy comes along that is so thoughtful and meaningful in addition to being funny that after seeing it a dozen times and laughing less often, I start noticing its depth and insight. For me, no movie has so perfectly united hilarity with profundity as \"Groundhog Day,\" which happens to be my favorite movie of all time.Superficially, this film belongs roughly in the same genre as \"All of Me\" and \"Liar Liar,\" comedies in which a character becomes the victim of some weird supernatural fate and must adapt to the insane logic of the situation. But Steve Martin and Jim Carrey are geniuses of physical comedy, whereas Bill Murray specializes in understatement. I can't imagine any other approach having worked for this film, where the world is going crazy around Phil the weatherman, Murray's hard-edged character who keeps his emotions bottled up. What makes the initial scenes in which he first discovers his fate so hilarious is the mounting panic in his demeanor even as he tries to act like everything's normal. All he can think of to say is, \"I may be having a problem.\" Uh, no kidding. Throughout the rest of the film, he'll deliver similarly muted lines to describe his situation, like \"My years are not advancing as fast as you might think.\" It's striking that a man who has all the time in the world would choose his words so carefully, but it reflects a well-conceived screenplay.In this comedy, the laughs are reinforced by repetition. The absurdity of Phil discovering that he's repeating the same day is funny enough, but every time that alarm clock goes off, and the radio starts playing, \"I Got You Babe,\" and Phil goes through the same motions and meets the same people and then goes out into the street to be accosted by the same annoying high school buddy (\"Phiiiil?\"), I laugh again because I'm reminded how funny it was the first time around. People who didn't like this film (I've met one or two) emphasize how annoying it is that everything gets repeated. I sort of understand that complaint, since jokes repeated over and over usually fail miserably. \"Groundhog Day,\" however, works uniquely well because the situation gets increasingly absurd and Phil gets increasingly desperate with each day that fails to pass.The film would have fizzled out quickly had it spent the entire hour-and-a-half showing Phil meeting the same people and doing the same things time and again. The fact that \"Groundhog Day\" avoids this fate is one of its more striking qualities, since most high-concept comedies of this sort fall apart in the third act. \"Groundhog Day\" is a rare example of one that completely follows through with its premise, leading from the initial situation logically to the ending. Only the Jeopardy scene feels like a skit that could have appeared anywhere. But this scene actually is placed wisely: it occurs when Phil is becoming increasingly bored and lethargic, and it is used to separate two hilarious scenes where he gives nutty television reports.It is in the middle, centering on Phil's attempts to seduce Rita, when the film reveals itself to be more than just a comedy. The underlying implication of these scenes is that Phil's powers are less important than he thinks they are. He probably could have done the same things (such as his exploits with Nancy) under ordinary circumstances, without the hocus pocus. In the end, his powers don't matter, because Rita is too smart and sees right through him. She may not understand the full supernatural implications of what he's doing, but she senses that he's somehow manipulating the situation. Phil may think he's a god, but he isn't all-powerful.Phil's character development is convincing largely because we can so easily believe the situation would force him to look inward. Because he loves such a sincere woman as Rita, the only way he can finally impress her is by genuinely changing himself rather than faking it. The change he undergoes isn't an implausible leap, for he maintains many of the same basic character traits he had at the beginning, even though he becomes kinder and more caring. Earlier, Rita says that egocentrism is Phil's \"defining characteristic,\" and, indeed, he doesn't stop being egocentric at the end; he merely learns to channel the egocentrism in a positive direction.I have trouble imagining any other actor having pulled this off. Murray is not the only comic actor to have proved himself capable of dramatic depth, but he's one of the few who can so seamlessly combine his humorous and serious side into the same character. And he's a master at conveying complex emotions through an apparent deadpan. When his delivery sounds stilted in this film, the effect is intentional, for he's playing a man whose life has become a script.Though this film has a serious message, it is still quintessentially a comedy. But it's a comedy that uses psychological exploration of a fascinating character to make its point. After the laughter has worn down, \"Groundhog Day\" turns out to be one of the richest and deepest films I've ever seen.",

                "I thought the film was terrific when I saw it in theaters twelve years ago. Recently in watching it again on cable, I was amazed at the quality of the screenplay. I didn't notice the first time. But on repeated viewings (like reliving Groundhog Day), I was impressed at the story created by the writers. This film is so much more than witty jokes and comic riffs arranged around a gimmick. It has an internal logic and consistency that is very rarely found in screenplays. No joke seemed disposable, and as you laugh your way along, the philosophy underlying the film takes over your imagination.Check the IMDb listings for this film's awards: look at the numerous British awards for writing. And yet this film was not even nominated for an Oscar. It is so rare that a film's jokes seem just as fresh more than a decade later, but I believe that is because the theme underlying the humor will never go out of fashion.The acting was terrific, and I now think this is Bill Murray's best work (though I didn't take it seriously when I first saw the film.) But the screenplay is the one of the finest ever written. I don't know if it's studied in film schools, but it ought to be.* * * * *ON HAROLD RAMIS' DEATH: Ramis told The Associated Press in a 2009 story about the 50th anniversary of Second City. \"When you hit it right, those things last.\"I found that quote in a story on Ramis' death.

Another example of this free creativity would be for me \"Back to the future\"... You can't go back in your past, but your imagination does! Here's the bottled-up feeling of eternity is excellently considered: the assets (you have time to learn, you know everything & every one...) and the pitfalls (a final boredom, the sadness of losing people without preventing it,...)Then, I realised that this movie is closer to every one's life than many others.... The revelation occurred while the chat between Bill Murray & 2 buddies at the bar:\"What would you do if you were stuck in one place, every day was exactly the same, nothing you did mattered ?\"\"That about sums it up for me;\"It's my life: I always complain about today is like yesterday & as tomorrow! Getting up tired, taking crowded subways, managing different kind of people with a perverse boss, back to the home to eat nearly the eternal same supper, complicated relationship..... Well, same day over, over & over....That's me, maybe you, and you or you..... This movie appeals to every one: Fantastic! And it offers in addition a solution: being socially generous.... Smile, help as much as you can & you will have the payback: your life will improve!!!! Zen, philosophy, psychology, religion says the same thing but in hundred years, thousand pages of writing..... Here's what a 2 hours movie can do!!!But that's not all: all this would have been impossible without this superb duo of Bill Murray & Andie MacDowell: I am a fan of both and they excel in this movie: I think they never have been closer than their true self: Murray has really two faces: the cynic & the kind... MacDowell: well, she smiles, she laughs, she plays, she is kind, romantic, honorable, trustful... the perfect soulmate for every one...And the final touch: the Director: Harold Ramis.. I was a fan of National lampoon, Ghostbusters and with his DVD commentary, I discover a great man: sympathetic, spiritual. He shares his enthusiasm with success and gives great insights for his movie (the symbolic & funny thanks of all the town as his motivation to direct...)So, if you have infinite time, enjoy this one as much..

It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).Pittsburgh weather-man Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent on assignment to Punxatawney, where on Groundhog Day each year the locals have a tradition of consulting the groundhog to find out if spring is imminent or if they should prepare for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil despises the job and the town, and can't wait to get it over with.... even though he has a soft spot for Rita (Andie MacDowell), the producer overseeing his broadcast. Phil's dislike of Punxatawney, its people and its traditions is set to get a hell of a lot worse though.... as when he awakens the next morning he finds himself reliving the same day. And so it goes - every time Phil gets up, it's still February 2nd and he seems destined to be stuck in the same day for the rest of eternity.It seems early on in the proceedings that the film might run out of steam and inspiration. After all, how can a film about a day which repeats itself be anything but repetitive? Thankfully, Groundhog Day is full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity. The film is laced with memorable dialogue, and Murray gets to play one of the defining roles of his career as a facetious, sharp-tongued misanthrope who ultimately learns the error of his ways. Groundhog Day is a very good film indeed, and restores one's faith in the imagination still lurking beneath the dismayingly shallow surface of Hollywood.",

                "In Harold Ramis's \"Groundhog Day\" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude. I love this movie \u0096 not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance, when Gods want to punish a mean, arrogant SOB, they would not take his sanity away \u0096 they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question, what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing? Groundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes; its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes, and it was very convincing. 9.5/10",

                "While GROUNDHOG DAY is not my favorite Bill Murray comedy, it is one of three brilliant comedies he made during the early 90s and all three are absolute must-sees. And, interestingly enough, while the film is very funny, it also has some wonderful and poignant moments--something I usually hate in comedies.The plot is pretty simple. Murray plays a jerk or a TV weather man who is sent against his will to cover the annual festivities concerning America's second favorite rodent, Punxsutawney Phil, as he tells us whether or not we'll have a long, hard winter (a very stupid tradition if you ask me). Naturally after having done this repeated times he's less than thrilled, but there's more to it than that--Murray is a nasty jerk and he delights in looking down on all the locals that take such pride in this event. Apparently, the fate is not happy with Murray, as he is oddly punished and made to repeat this same day again and again and again. Why exactly is unknown but his reactions to this exact same day are priceless--ranging from insanely funny to weird to touching.In addition to Murray's excellent performance, Andi McDowell does a good job in support and the film makers really did a wonderful job of capturing the wacky essence of small town America as well as creating a wonderful and quirky script.This film is terrific--you must see this film...now!",

The Screenplay Written by Danny Rubin & Ramis himself, is simply marvelous. Ramis's Direction, on the other-hand, is efficient. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are pitch-perfect.Performance-Wise: Murray is Terrific! The legendary actor delivers a yet another performance, that deserves to be respected.

                "One of the great films, \"Groundhog Day\" is a satisfying romantic comedy that also works as an exploration of existential and philosophical concepts.Phil (Bill Murray) is a Pittsburgh weatherman who must cover the Groundhog Day festivities for the fourth year in a row. He reluctantly travels to Puxatawney, PA with cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) to record the antics of Puxatawney Phil. After they get there, he is caught in a time loop, making him relive February 2nd over and over.Before he goes to Puxatawney, Phil is tired of his boring life. To him, it feels like everyday is the same--more clouds, more precipitation, more cold fronts. He is abrasively sarcastic and genuinely depressed.When he is forced to live a life where literally everyday is essentially the same, he learns to appreciate the small things. And he realizes that he is the primary variable in his own life; it is up to him to appreciate the little things and to make the most of his time.The script is terrific. Not only does it hold together on scrutiny, it is touching and funny. Bill Murray straddles the line between humorous and meanness perfectly, affecting a transformation that is believable. Andie MacDowell does a good job portraying a woman who is essentially romantic and optimistic, but wary of Phil's intentions. Chris Elliott is self-deprecating and perfectly tuned to his role as an immature schlub.I know I am not alone in saying I have watched \"Groundhog Day\" so many times I have lost count. Its appeal is so great, it easily bears rewatching, like \"The Wizard of Oz\". In my estimation, Bill Murray has two of the top comedies of our time with \"Groundhog Day\" and \"What About Bob?\"",

                "Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a weatherman for a local news station. Every year he goes to Puxatawney, Pennsylvania for the Puxatawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring.Well, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.Andie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager :)--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. Only one problem. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option: Stay in Puxatawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. Again. Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same as it was the day before. He knows everything that is going to happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja-vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday. Again. Technically.So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.Part of what makes \"Groundhog Day\" so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale \"A Christmas Story,\" which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called \"Scrooged.\" Anyway. Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, \"I'm-smarter-than-you\" face. He thinks himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.Harold Ramis, director of \"Analyze This,\" star of \"Stripes,\" directed \"Groundhog Day.\" Bill and he are old pals, and it sure shows. I bet they had a great time making this movie. But what is good about it is that while making a fun movie they didn't forget to come up with an interesting and audience-catching tale.Another thing that is great about \"Groundhog Day\" is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example: When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but \"Groundhog Day\" does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck, never have bought a Ferarri, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of \"Groundhog Day.\" I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash - it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (although my conscience would still get in the way.) There was a little comedy with John Candy named \"Delirious.\" It was about a soap opera writer getting trapped in his own world. And everything he writes on his typewriter comes true. While the movie was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control any - and every- thing, and he didn't do them. I think that's where \"Groundhog Day\" steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature - in other words, I love watching the character do something the average human would do when given the power(s). And that's exactly what Phil does in \"Groundhog Day.\" And that is why, among other things, it is one of my favorites.5/5 stars",

Essentially it is a one-joke comedy, but what makes Groundhog Day so delightful is that whereas it could have been derivative and predictable, the film is always full of life and full to the brim with fresh ideas.

                "Often you hear the adage, \"It is just a film\". Well, for most times it is true. But on rarest of rare occasions, it isn't. This was one of them. Like a great piece literature, painting, poetry, speech it has the capacity to change the way you feel and think. It is the biggest compliment I can pay to a film. I rank Groundhog Day with Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Waking Life, Synecdoche New York, Tokyo Story, Ikiru as one of the moves that has the capacity to change.It is anything but a preachy film as the \"intro\" to the review might suggest. In fact it an extremely entertaining and funny film with one of the best performances ever by Bill Murray. The plot revolves around a weather man (Bill Murray) is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting \"rat\" (as he calls it). This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realization that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing every day.The challenge here for the makers was in terms of screenplay, editing and performances. Bear in mind that, the \"loops\" Bill Murray's character goes through, might become redundant for the audience after a while. This is where the genius of Harold Ramis and Bill Murray comes into play, who seem to introduce a \"novelty\" factor with every shot of the same sequence. I couldn't think of any actor other than Murray who could have pulled this one off.It is a movie likely to deceive you in its effortless narrative and casual comic tone. Yes, it is funny, but make no mistake about it, it is a film with a strong philosophical undertone. This is a quality that separates Groundhog from rest of the movies with similar intent. It tells you what it intends to on your terms. It deals with the questions that bother us for a better part of our lives i.e. meaning of life, purpose of life, existentialism, death, god but never preaches, nor propels any propaganda. But by the end of it, you know that something has changed, something you didn't see coming has happened. And then you watch it again only to realize the moment of Epiphany that eluded you the first time.Every time I am down or losing perspective this is the movie that eases everything and makes me ask a simple question, \"What is important?\".

                "This one is a winner in almost all respects, a kind of comic Twilight Zone episode that never quits.  Murray has had roles in which he does nothing funny but seems to stand around waiting for laughs anyway, wearing a goofy expectant smile, as in \"Stripes.\"  But not here.  This is probably his best role.  He may still have the goofy expression but this time the laughs arrive on time.The movie excells at three levels.One is the overall conception, the comic theme itself.  Murray, a sarcastic and sadistic weatherman finds himself stuck in a small dreary town in Pennsylvania with two colleagues, one of them Andie MacDowell, his producer. They cover the local Groundhog Day celebration then find themselves unable to leave because of a blizzard.  The next morning Murray wakes up to find that it's the same Groundhog Day all over again.  And the next morning too. And so on ad almost infinitum.  So far so good.  A nice concept but it could go either way, depending on how it's handled.  In fact, it's handled very well.  What could have been a one-gag movie that ran out of steam after the first quarter hour turns instead into a neatly logical progression of plot and character development.  Murray of course is the centerpiece of the tale and it is his changes that occupy our attention; the other roles, although well done, are mostly there to provide reflections on Murray's moral evolution.  (Andie MacDowell, wardrobed in slacks, white blouse and checked vest, and done up with long fluffy curly black hair, looks radiantly appealing.)Murray's reaction discovering that he is now living Day Two is one of a terrible anxiety.  He manages to get this across effectively, even though it is tinged with his own brand of distant amusement.  On Day Three he is depressed and gets drunk.  On Day Four he realizes that tomorrow will have no consequences and tests this hypothesis by breaking all of the rules of traffic.  As the days pass, he plans to seduce MacDowell, and he implements his plan cleverly, discovering more and more about her -- her favorite drink, her favorite toast, the kind of man she is looking for.  He has so much time on his hands that he learns to play the piano expertly because MacDowell likes men who play instruments.  His scheme seems to be working but no matter how perfect his playacting he simply cannot get her into bed in one single day -- and every day he must start over with her from scratch. (\"Twelve years of Catholic school speaking,\" she tells him.) Eventually, however, he comes to realize that he really DOES care for her because, after all, he's gotten to know her quite well with the passage of time, although she doesn't know it.  When he undergoes this epiphany he goes about doing good, no longer just acting nice but actually BEING nice, whether it advances his desire to get her in the sack or not.  Obliquely, indirectly, it works without his having intended it to.  She falls for him and they live happily ever after.  That's the overall conception and it's very well handled.Level Two is the script, the dialogue, and this too is superior.  How many movies can throw in a handfull of quotes from Sir Walter Scott and people of that ilk -- one quote is in French -- without making a contemporary audience, used to MTV, squirm?  \"And winter/ slumbering in the open ground/ wears upon his smiling face/ a dream of spring.\"  And it isn't just stuck into the script; it fits into the scene and is an appropriate comment on the plot.  But more than that, the lines are not only intelligent but sometimes very witty.  Just a few examples that come to mind.On Day Two, I believe, Murray is sitting in a bowling alley with two local drunks, bemoaning his fate.  He once spent a beautiful day in the Carribean with a gorgeous girl.  They drank pina coladas.  They watched the sun go down and then they made love like two otters.  Why couldn't he be stuck in THAT day instead of this one?  \"How would you feel,\" he asks his pals, \"if you woke up every morning and it was the same awful day and nothing you ever did made the slightest difference because nothing meant anything?\"  One of the drunks, glumly replies:  \"That about sums it up.\"On Day Three, Murray and MacDowell are sitting in the Tip Top Cafe and he has a huge tray of fattening food in front of him.  He lights a cigaretteand stuffs whipped-cream pastries into his mouth.  MacDowell:  \"I hate to see a man of your advanced years destroying himself.\"  Murray:  \"Maybe they're not advancing as fast as you think.\"Last example from dialogue, somewhere down the time line, after he's begun worming his way into her affections:  Murray and MacDowell are walking along at night in the snow, her arm through his, and she tells him, \"Thank you for a very nice day.  It's the kind of day that could never be planned.\" Murray:  \"Well -- it CAN be planned but it takes a lot of work.\"The third level at which the movie works is, very simply, the actual small bits of business that the actors involve themselves in.  Ramis, the director, plays the doctor who checks out X-rays of Murray's skull to see if there's any pathology.  Ramis stares at the photos and says, \"No clots, no tumors, no aneurysms -- at least as far as I can see,\" then he turns around and squints tightly and rapidly three time in a row.  (Who thinks up something like that?)  And Murray takes a girl to a Clint Eastwood movie and does an expert impression of Eastwood, from the Man With No Name costume to the voice.  When he turns his back and speaks, it sounds exactly like Eastwood.  There are running gags about things like innocent-looking but bottomless puddles in the gutter.  I know that some of these things sound old, but they are so well realized here that we can forget their age. They seem born anew, just like Murray.There is one danger in a story like this that the movie skirts neatly. The romance between Murray and MacDowell, had more been made of it, could easily have turned cloying.  That's what happens to Jack London's characters in \"The Sea Wolf.\"  You've got to handle this carefully, because, as we all know, comedy in itself is of no significance.  (How many comedies win academy awards?)  The movie has to be about something deeper, of course, and the sort of logic that comes to that conclusions must also come to the conclusion that the audience consists of an unwashed horde of semi-moronic dolts who must have the \"seriousness\" pounded into their heads with a sixteen-pound sledge hammer.  The problem is deftly avoided in \"Groundhog Day.\"  The romance is funny more often than not.  And during the moments when it isn't played for laughs, it advances our understanding of the changes in Murray's character.  And MacDowell looks angelic enough that Murray's growing feelings for her are believable.  I should also mention the use of appropriate musical numbers on the track.  \"The Pennsylvania Polka\" is used as punctuation throughout.  Midway through the movie, we get Ray Charles' \"You Don't Know Me,\" underlining the uncertainty of the romance. By the end we have an even more romantic theme from Rachmaninoff that begins in sincerity and ends in a jolly jazzed-up version.This is one of the best comedies of the last ten or fifteen years, including \"The In Laws\" and \"The Freshman\" and \"My Cousin Vinny.\"  Before that, there were \"Love at First Bite\" and \"Murder by Death.\"  Pure comedies, successful ones, come along rarely.",

Bill Murray played Phil Connors, a egocentric and grumpy weatherman in Pennsylvania who goes to Punxsutawny, Pa every year to see if the groundhog sees his shadow for the local television station with his producer, played by the wonderful Andie MacDowell, and his cameraman, played by a low keyed Chris Elliot.Everything goes as Phil expects on the first day, except he is caught in a blizzard and has to stay the night. The next morning he awakes and it's Groundhog Day again! This pattern happens over and over again until he realizes he cannot escape Groundhog Day. In time Phil realizes the advantages of knowing what's going to happen before it happens and Murray takes full comic advantage of it. However if this film was just that, it would be just a normal run of the mill comedy.

Some may think that this guy is evil since he can toy around with anyone without getting implicated. Bill Murray was the ideal character for this film since he is egocentric and sarcastic.

                "I'm pretty sure everyone in America has seen Groundhog Day, and that most of America watches it every year on the holiday itself. I'm included in the latter and have seen the movie over twenty times with my family. We eat Angel food cake, stuffing it in our mouths when Bill Murray does onscreen, and we drink sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist. Even as kids, we drank bitters to pretend we could fit in with Andie MacDowell. We even have a relative who tried to calculate just how many Groundhog Days Bill lived through! Our family is hardly unique, and I'm sure millions of others enjoy the same ritual every February 2nd.Bill Murray will forever be immortalized in American cinema for his role as an unlikable, sarcastic, jaded weatherman assigned to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania with his socially awkward cameraman, Chris Elliot, and his new, optimistic producer, Andie MacDowell, to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. I love this movie, but I would love it even more had Michael Keaton accepted the role, because in scenes where the character is supposed to show growth and new kindness, Bill's not particularly convincing. He is extremely convincing during most of the movie, when he's irritable, rude, and condescending. And, since this movie is a fantasy about living the same day over and over again with no consequences, it's cathartic for the audience to watch Bill's socially inacceptable behavior. How many times have we longed to tell off an irritating salesman? Bill gets to punch Stephen Tobolowsky in the face for us!There's so much to love about this movie, full of contrasts and imagination. Sweet Andie MacDowell is contrasted by Marita Geraghty's silliness. Everyone in the town takes themselves so seriously, providing the perfect surreal surrounding for Bill Murray's distaste. On the drive over, he insults the entire town, calling the residents \"hicks\" and \"morons\", setting the stage for a truly moving transformation. In Harold Ramis's iconic, inventive classic, audiences get to reappreciate small town charm, shrug off years of indifference and assumptions, learn to believe in love, and have faith in the belief that anyone can change. No matter how awful someone is, given several hundred second chances, he can change. And, in the ultimate lesson of optimism, even a simple bad day can turn into a lifechanging good one.",

Each actor fleshes out their character to perfection. Bill Murray as Phil, the celebrity sloucher TV Weatherman, gleefully skating through life without a care in the world... Taking absolutely nothing, nor any human being, the least bit seriously... Himself included! Andie MacDowell, as the 24/7 ear-to-ear-smile-on-her-face, World\u00b4s Number 1 Optimist... Who is just impossible NOT to love! Stephen Tobolowsky as the Always In-Your-Face, Always Closing, Insurance Salesman! Chris Elliot as the steadfast, never complain about being treated horribly Assistant and most loyal of Friends! Well... I am almost positive no other cast member has more than a minute or two of on-screen time... So... Really don\u00b4t need to mention anyone else.... Do I???WOW! And so many life lessons in Groundhog Day to be learned! If You don\u00b4t get it RIGHT the first time..... Well.... It\u00b4s GROUNDHOG Day!!! ....to strains of the local town Orchestra playing...

This comedy stands alone as one of the funniest and most original movies of the 90's. Not many comedies can be funny and also end with a moral. Groundhog Day has both.

                "GROUNDHOG DAY is a classic comedy of 1993 that goes to show that the best premises are the simple ones. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as a jerk of a local TV weatherman who finds himself forced to live the same mundane day over and over again. I was partly dreading this because of the focus on his romance with Andie MacDowell, fearing another vomit-inducing film in the style of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, but I needn't have worried. MacDowell is very good here (although the film belongs to Murray) and the romance handled sensitively. However, it's much more than just a romance. It's a film which explores the human condition and has a lesson for both Murray and the viewers in how to treat people. It's funny rather than preachy, and comes across in a very similar fashion to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE except with many more laugh-out-loud moments.",

        "synopsis": "In a retro-futuristic version of the 1960s, a superhuman named Robert \"Bob\" Parr (better known by his superhero alias \"Mr Incredible\") fights crime as an undercover superhero using his powers of super-strength in the city of Metroville (a parody of Metropolis). one afternoon while on the way to his wedding, Bob helps an elderly woman with her cat, stops a police car chase, prevents the suicide of the local bank president Oliver Sansweet and attempts to prevent a French clown-like super-villain named Bomb Voyage from robbing the Metroville Bank. whilst attempting to save the bank, a 10-year-old fan boy named Buddy Pine wants to be Mr Incredible's sidekick, and unintentionally interferes, causing Bomb Voyage to get away and blow up part of a monorail system. Bob makes it to his wedding late and marries his longtime girlfriend Helena Truax (better known by her super-heroine alias \"Elastagirl\", who is also a superhuman and is capable of changing the shape and size of her body via stretching). shortly after their marriage, Mr Incredible is sued in Superior Court by Oliver Sansweet and the injured train passengers, leading to the government eventually banning all super-humans from using their superpowers in public.\n15 years later, Bob and Helen are now living a quiet suburban life with their three new children, Violet Parr (a 15-year-old social outcast who has the powers of invisibility and force fields), Dashiell Robert \"Dash\" Parr (a 10-year-old sporty troublemaker who has the power of super-speed) and Jacob \"Jack-Jack\" Parr (an infant capable of multiple superpowers unknown to the family). the family is often now struggling with everyday life problems and is sometimes dysfunctional, and Bob is bored with his new job as a clerk for the business company Insuricare, thus secretly trying to sneak out at night as a masked vigilante with his longtime best friend Lucious Best (better known by his superhero alias \"Frozone\", who is also a superhuman and has the power of freezing things). one day, Bob loses his temper with his grumpy boss Mr Gilbert Huph who refuses to let him stop a nearby mugging during a private meeting, and Bob angrily smashes him through the office and is fired. when he arrives home, worrying what Helen will think, Bob finds a message from an overseas scientist named Mirage who tells him she is working for a base on a remote island and they need his help to shut down an out-of-control AI-controlled robot known as the \"Omnidroid\" which is terrorising their laboratory. Bob sees this as an opportunity to become a superhero again, and leaves, telling Helen that he has been sent to a conference.\nas Mr Incredible, Bob is flown overseas to a tropical jungle island. Mirage warns him that the Omnidroid has an advanced artificial intelligence and is designed to teach itself, so that Bob should not fight it too much. Bob lands in the jungle, and the Omnidroid appears, revealing its appearance as a gigantic octopus-like droid. Bob battles with the machine, finding it almost invincible, but eventually manages to destroy it in a volcano. after he is sent home, Bob notices a tear in his costume and seeks the help of his fashion designer, Edna \"E\" Mode. Edna tells Bob that he cannot use a cape during battles, due to many superheroes in the past dying from cape-related accidents, and she designs him a new red and yellow suit to replace his old blue and red suit. incorrectly assuming he has told his family about going back into superhero business, Edna decides to design new suits for the entire family.\nBob is sent back to the island to have a meeting with Mirage, but when he arrives, he discovers that Mirage is really a secret agent who is the second-in-command for a crime lord and cereal killer known as \"Syndrome\", and his mission was only a test for the Omnidroid's abilities. Bob is attacked again by the now-updated Ominidroid and Syndrome appears. Syndrome reveals himself to really be an adult Buddy Pine who now seeks revenge on Bob for rejecting him as a sidekick. Syndrome throws Bob into a lake and attempts to kill Bob with a miniature bomb, but Bob escapes via swimming through a cave, though Syndrome assumes him to be dead.\nat nightfall, Bob sneaks into Syndrome's secret base lair and looks into his computer files. Bob finds that Syndrome has been secretly planning and thus far succeeding in a mass genocide scheme known as \"Operation: Kronos\", and has been testing previous Omnidroid replicas via killing past superheroes and has plans already to kill Helen. suddenly, Mirage catches Bob and Syndrome has him imprisoned.\nmeanwhile, Helen notices the tear in Bob's costume and visits Edna to have it mended. Edna, assuming she knows what Bob has been up to, shows Helen all the suits she has made for the family. Helen, now confused and concerned, calls Insuricare to make sure she knows where he is, but is surprised to discover he has been fired. using Edna suit-tracking device, Helen finds that Bob has travelled to a tropical remote island. she takes the new suits home and borrows a jet from her longtime pilot friend, Snug Porter, and uses it to pursue Bob. Helen soon realises that Violet and Dash have snuck into the plane, angering her but also prompting her to fear for their safety. Syndrome tracks them down and attempts to kill them with missiles, but Helen manages to save her kids as the plane explodes, although Syndrome assumes them to be dead.\nHelen shifts her body into speedboat-shape, and manages to bring her children to the island. over night, they camp in a cave, and Helen leaves to find Bob, telling the kids that they must use their powers in case of emergency. the kids eventually escape the cave by morning, after realising it was part of a volcano. they are picked up by Syndrome's henchmen who they battle with. after Bob is freed by Helen and Mirage (although Helen becomes suspicious about Bob having a relationship with Mirage), they join their kids into the battle. this is all eventually broken up by Syndrome, who imprisons them all.\nSyndrome reveals his evil plan to the family, that he will become the hero he dreamed of being by pretending to save the world from his own creations, and selling superhero inventions so that everyone will have fake superpowers of their own and mutant super-humans will no longer have a place in the world. Syndrome unleashes his most biggest and powerful Omnidroid replica on Metroville, and pretends to battle with it by remote-controlling it and using his gadgets on it. but, due its artificial intelligence, manages to outsmart him and knocks away his controller and knocks him unconscious. the family are broken out by Violet (with help from the reformed Mirage) and use one of Syndrome's jets to fly to Metroville. with the help of Frozone, and Syndrome's remote, they manage to destroy the Omnidroid by smashing one of its claws through its power source. when Syndrome awakens, he is jealous to find that the \"Incredibles\" are now accepted by the public as superheroes despite the law, and he vows revenge. after they are transported home, the family find Syndrome attempting to kidnap Jack-Jack. when Jack-Jack awakens, Syndrome threatens him, and Jack-Jack manages to use his own powers to traumatise him and force him to let go. a traumatised Syndrome attempts to escape in his plane, but is sucked cape-first into the jet's engine, killing him and causing the plane to crash on their house.\nmonths later, the family have moved to a motel. Dash is a champion at the school athletics, and Violet asks out her boyfriend Tony \"Anthony\" Rydinger. as the family head home, a gigantic drilling war machine appears, driven by a miner-like super-villain with a mole-like face. the criminal gives him name as the \"Underminer\" and declares war, as the family grin in their suits and know they must save the world.",

                "Writer-director Brad Bird here has something that I was caught off-guard by just a bit. I always expect Pixar films to be above-par, family entertainment, the kinds of films that can have an appeal to adults on a satirical, jab-in-the-side effect by having the characters reacting to each other as they would on a film with a higher rating, whilst giving the bright colors, action, and silliness that appeals to kids. Watching The Incredibles, their sixth feature-length offering, I wasn't so entertained and amused since their 98 film A Bug's Life, and it almost brought me back to the emotional impact I felt when in the theater for the first time getting Toy Story into my system. It's a film that takes on a type in society that we all know well (in the past they've done toys, bugs, monsters, undersea life, and now comic book archetypes) and transforms it superbly to the imaginative computer-animated landscape. This is also in credit due to Brad Bird, who proved five years ago with his sleeper The Iron Giant that he could transcend the genre and appeal with heart and vigor for almost every age bracket.So what little touches make The Incredibles so appealing? How it starts to deconstruct the idea of a superhero, perhaps, as well as how the family unit is shown in the usual conventions under unusual and funny circumstances. As an example, one of our heroes Mr. Incredible, a.k.a. Bob Parr (voiced wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson), goes to visit a woman who fixes and creates the uniforms of superheroes. In one scene she explains why a cape is not a good idea. This is the kind of scene that might not make it into most Hollywood movies, and would sometimes if not often be discredited as being too 'smart' for kids to get. But by appealing to a kind of level late teens and adults can relate to, it reaches a higher, far more intelligent plane. In fact, many of the best scenes in the film take on what we all know in films displaying the 'family unit' and morph it with the power and imagination of superheroes.I won't go too much into the plot as some may already have, except to say that what makes the story in and of itself appealing is how it is a fully formed story, and doesn't try and sell itself short like other animated films (i.e. Sharktale for example). It also uses it's PG-rating perimeter wisely, and Bird and company create action sequences that are as exciting, if not more so, than in the action films that have been released this year (in fact, some of the scenes in the climax, for my money, could rival a couple of those in Spider-Man 2). By setting up the right emotional bases with the characters- Bob, his wife Elasti-girl (Holly Hunter), their kids, and with supporting characters voiced finitely by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee, by the time the high-charged, internally fantasy scenes take off, they take off with great conviction and excitement.Overall, The Incredibles is a film that is, in a way, what audiences wish they could get and rarely do- it's a film with wit and observance, a kind of video-game where the results are not as expectable as can be. Some kids may not get it as much as adults might, which is just as well, as it sometimes operates on a level like Antz did, only through the sphere of Disney. In other words, if you say the teaser trailer, which involved the out-of-shape Mr. Incredible trying with all his might to buckle his tights, you'll know what the film could bring. Personally, I can't wait to see it again.",

                "This is one of the finest animated films I have ever seen. Not only is it a fine animated film, it is a great film period. The film obviously takes its cue from several real life super hero comic books, especially The Fantastic Four and the Justice Society of America. The Fantastic Four comparison is obvious due to the fact that Elatigirl and Violet were obviously inspired by Mr. Fantastic (aka. Reed Richards) and the Invisible Woman (aka. Sue Storm Richards) respectively. The J.S.A. influence is a little more obscure. Several years ago, DC Comics issued a mini-series that attempted to explain the demise of the Justice Society by claiming that the group was forced to disband after their loyalty to America was questioned during the 1950's. In this film, all the heroes were forced into hiding after the government refused to pay for wrongful legal claims brought against the super heroes of this film. Also, there are many in jokes that the casual viewer might not get, but that made it enjoyable for comic book fans. This the island scenes look as if they could have been inspired by many of the series produced by Gerry Anderson of the 1960's (eg. the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet).Another thing that made this film unique was its look. If you notice, the city where the story takes place looks like a fairly modern metropolis. However, if you look at the cars in the film, most of them look as if they would have been more at home in the mid to late 1960's. Also, the way that many of the characters were dressed also could have put them in that time.However, the thing that I really loved about this film was the fact that even though it was geared primarily to children, it was dark enough in theme to appeal to adults. In fact, there are a couple of scenes that you wouldn't normally associate with a film geared towards children.This film is definitely a classic of animation and once again Pixar shows why they are the masters of computer animation.",

                "Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired \"Shark Tale\", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with \"The Incredibles\". And while I have to say that I liked \"Finding Nemo\" a bit better, \"The Incredibles\" is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a \"hip\" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. \"The Incredibles\" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that \"everybody is special\" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.\"The Incredibles\", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended.****1/2 of ***** stars",

                "WOW! What a movie. I can honestly say this is in my top ten movies of all time, how do Pixar continue to out do themselves at every movie release?The Incredibles is a fantastic story, wonderfully scripted and with the most stunning animation you have ever seen, it provides a perfectly rounded story with plenty of action, laughs and (almost) tears.Basically, this is a story of a man encountering a mid life crisis and leaping headlong into it without a care or a thought for his family, proving exceedingly selfish and failing to see the good in his life. Meanwhile the wife is left to try and look after the family. Really, that's the story. Now, what Pixar have done is drop in the idea that the parents are Superheroes, banned from being Super many years previously by the Government and the people, trying to live a normal life. Add to the mix that some of their children have inherited their own powers and that the Super villains are planning a comeback, and you have this wonderful movie.I can't begin to convey how wonderful the animation is, it's perfect. I mean you'll always be looking at it knowing it's animation, but when the story takes you along you'll suddenly realize you're still watching animation. The subtle difference is that you forget, and there are parts (for instance when the father is cheering his son during the race) that you actually think it is real. The effects for water, fire (two of the hardest things to recreate in animation) and lava are wonderful to watch and caught me drawing a breath when I first saw them.The characters and acting are wonderful, and you will find yourself caring about them as real people. At some points I could feel a big swallow coming up and a wavering adams apple, obviously due to the food earlier, nothing to do with the movie.I often find that movies aren't paced well, that they either have too long or too short an introduction to the characters, or the events that lead up to the pivotal point of the movie are unbalanced against the climax, all sorts of combinations. Not here, this move is perfect and well balanced, the story takes you along just when you are ready, and there were no points where I wished we could move on, or something could happen quicker. My only frustration were at the kids, and this was only because they were behaving exactly as real kids would.It was interesting to see the comparisons and links to other famous Superheroes through comic-lore. Definitely with nods to The Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and huge nods to The Watchmen. My only concern is that there is so much similarity to The Watchmen that those who haven't read the graphic novel will be saying \"That's the Incredibles movie\" when Watchmen finally comes to fruition.The short film showing before this was wonderful in itself, and had the audience laughing out loud loads. Excellent, and once again, outdoes every short that they've produced before. Boundin' was beautifully animated and wonderfully told. Guaranteed to bring a huge big smile to your face.All in all I think this movie is perfect and truly incredible.",

                "I finally saw Pixar/Disney's \"The Incredibles\" after several scheduling glitches. Writer and Director Brad Bird's \"The Incredibles\" is truly incredible. It is one of the best movies of the year. The CGI animation is both cutting edge and simply stunning, and like all Pixar projects it has a solid story as it's foundation. Bird uses the Superhero mythology to tell a funny and poignant story: that when we forfeit or withhold our greatness, we are not being true to ourselves, and more importantly it is a disservice to those around us. As the story begins, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) was the superhero's Superhero. As voiced by Nelson, Mr. Incredible, is very confident, on the verge of cocky. He uses his super strength and powers for good. He marries super, Elasticgirl (Holly Hunter). However, Mr. Incredible soon falls victim like his fellow \"Supers\" to the plight of our litigious society-- the people they save are suing them. Instead of getting malpractice insurance (which would have been a different movie), the persecuted... and prosecuted Supers assume their secret identities in a covert government relocation program. They also promise never to use their powers again even for good.We catch up 15 years later with Mr. Incredible, now just Bob Parr, insurance claim adjuster. He is suffering. His wife Helen, the former Elasticgirl, is busy getting settled in their new home with their kids, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and little Jack Jack. Violet and Dash have super powers, and Jack Jack is not yet toilet trained. Bob is totally frustrated by his job, and really the lie he is forced to live. Every week he and fellow Super, Lucius Best aka Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), on their \"bowling\" night, listen to the police radio band so that they can save people in danger. Mild mannered life is killing Bob. He tells Helen regarding Dash's 4th grade graduation, that they keep \"creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity\".One day Bob is contacted by the mysterious, Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), enlisting his super powers for an undisclosed benefactor. Bob, still super strong, no longer has the six pack abdominals. He proceeds to train and trim the waistline. He sees his suit designer, Edna 'E' Mode (Brad Bird), to fix his super suit. In a hilarious exchange, E enrolls Mr. Incredible in a new suit, sans cape. It is disclosed that the benefactor is villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee). Turns out that Mr. Incredible was the one responsible for Syndrome's genesis when he invalidated the young Syndrome 15 years ago. Thus, we have the classic Superhero tale of conflict and revenge.What also distinguishes \"The Incredibles\" along with the story about reclaiming greatness, is that it is about family. In a very touching scene when Mr. Incredible is about to do battle with the seemingly invincible Omnidroid, he admits to Helen \"...I'm not strong enough...\" Having super powers is great. Having the love of family is truly powerful. Craig T. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible. He is bold, funny, and endearingly vulnerable. Holly Hunter is solid and folksy as Helen, who also projects a quiet power. Jason Lee is at his annoying best as Syndrome. Brad Bird as 'E' steals every scene that she is in. Director Brad Bird's \"The Incredibles\" is amazing to look at, and also has something special and touching to say.",

                "I hope that this movie does really well because this has to be one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The story is really cool and it's obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.The movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60's 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I'm not saying it's dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren't out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film's villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film's credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.Even though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you'd see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can't pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for 'monologuing'. He was also one ruthless bastard, I'll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times. In fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That's exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one. He pulled it off and hopefully this will attract attention to his other animated film, \"The Iron Giant\", which was sadly overlooked when it was released and is also a really great film.All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough. I left very satisfied and felt no need to compare this to the rest of Pixar's movies. This one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year and rightfully deserves its place among the best animated movies of all time.RATING: ***** out of *****.",

It's what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it's excellent entertainment.The visuals and sound are very impressive, but it's the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action. The action, as in many modern-day films, was overdone in the last half hour of the movie but overall....the DVD is a good investment since people 3 to 63 should enjoy this.As an adult, it's not always easy to keep my attention for two hours with animation but the fact this movie does, tells you how good the story is presented.

                "Although \"The Incredibles\" is not the best film Pixar has released (via Disney) since 1995's \"Toy Story,\" I felt it is the most epic. When I went to go see \"Toy Story\" in 1995, the epic scale of the picture -- the non-stop frantic pace, the action sequences, etc. -- were all so breathtaking that it contained the same tour de force attitude as, believe it or not, a blockbuster such as \"Terminator 2\": a crowd-pleasing, overwhelming picture.\"Monsters, Inc.\" wasn't quite as epic. It was a great movie, just as good as \"Toy Story,\" but it didn't have the same style per se. \"Finding Nemo\" was very good as well but still didn't capture the same epic scale as \"Toy Story.\" (I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just different.) \"The Incredibles\" seemed to. I saw it on DVD and from beginning to end the action is non-stop, the laughs aplenty, and the exotic locations and action-hero references continuous. For this reason, somehow, it reminded me very much of \"Toy Story.\" It seemed like older Pixar, rather than some of their newer stuff (all of which is great as well). Pixar has yet to make a bad movie. Even their worst -- \"A Bug's Life\" -- was better than most animated films.\"The Incredibles\" also returns to the spoof roots of \"Monsters, Inc.\" and \"Toy Story\" (something \"Finding Nemo\" did but not as often) -- it parodies cultural references. (Something hard to do in an underwater sea adventure.) Although this is a family film, it is NOT a \"children's film.\" That is evident from the beginning when the fake news reel in \"The Incredibles\" features articles about a suicidal man suing superheroes because he \"didn't want to be saved.\" This is clearly a tongue-in-cheek criticism of the shameless legal standards of the day. (Such as the woman who sued McDonald's because her coffee was too hot. A true story!) Another film might not be clever enough to integrate iconic cultural references into itself but \"The Incredibles\" does.Similarly, using superheroes, Pixar examines the at-home relationship of a family and spoofs our own rituals. (Such as eating at the dinner table -- the mom tries to stop the squabbling kids just like we do, only because she has superpowers, it's a bit... different.) All in all \"The Incredibles\" really is a great animated film. I enjoyed it more than \"Finding Nemo\" (which I didn't expect to as I loved \"Nemo\") and just as much as \"Toy Story\" and \"Monsters, Inc.\" Pixar has solidified a new style of family film-making -- the cultural parody animated film -- and the evidence of this can be seen in such take-offs of the formula as \"Shrek\" and \"Shark Tale\" (which featured many cultural references as well).All in all \"The Incredibles\" is incredibly fun.

                "The Incredibles is a great film, and probably my favourite Pixar picture (Toy Story is the best, but that's different to favourite). It takes a while to properly get into the action, but when it does, it delivers it in spades.And that's exactly it. I would actually call The Incredibles an animated action film, because to be honest, I don't think there was enough comedy to call it an animated action comedy film. There are quite a few funny moments, but the gags don't come as fast as Finding Nemo or Toy Story.That being said, it does have truly amazing action set-pieces, brilliant voice acting, a fabulous script, wonderful characters and the animation is simply.....well....incredible.The music is definitely a stand-out. It actually made me smile, with it's jazzy tones and James Bond type scores.One of the greatest things about The Incredibles is that it's not a kiddies film; it's completely different to all the other Pixar films. They bring out tommy guns in the second scene, for crying out loud! If you want to see a more adult animated film, then go see The Incredibles, and enjoy every minute. But I wouldn't bring someone younger than 4 maybe, because it isn't really aimed at them, and they probably would find it quite scary.This is a great film, one of the best of 2004 in my opinion. If it just had a slightly higher gag rate, than this would be an absolutely perfect picture.9/10",

I don't think it is Pixar's best, that's Toy Story, but it's certainly not the weakest, that's Cars though that was a worthy film as well. The animation is spot on, and just adds to the inventive feel of the film, and is helped enormously by an innovative plot that is the source of the film's originality. The story is very fast-paced, if perhaps a little slow to begin with, and the script is filled with humour to satisfy even the fussiest child. The characters are very well-done, thanks to the excellent voice cast, standouts are Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, and My Name is Earl's Jason Lee is a big surprise as the villain Syndrome. Brad Bird's Edna was a hoot too. The film however, does have two flaws, it is overlong and sometimes drags consequently, and it is a little too violent at times, the last half-hour especially. Overall, an excellent family film, not perfect, but anybody who's seen some of the Disney direct to video sequels, save one or two exceptions will agree that the Incredibles does a much better job at entertaining than they did. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

                "'The Incredibles (2004)' is a masterclass in character, always putting its central family in front of its superb superhero action. That action is often somewhat counter-intuitively but cleverly conveyed using the tropes and language of the spy genre, giving the movie a decidedly 60s flavour in the process. The piece is a much more mature affair than you might expect, being a family film in every sense of the word - a movie suitable for kids as opposed to one made for them. It is nuanced, affecting and will actually pay off more for the older members of its audience. It plays like a live-action picture with the world's most convincing special effects, since they're rendered exactly like the rest of the flick, and some of the most convincing characters, too. What makes the film so fantastic is that it's genuinely entertaining all the way through. It's properly funny, intriguing, suspenseful, emotionally impactful and exciting. What's so impressive is that it easily rises to the top of its genre, standing amongst the best of its peers (and even, in itself, commenting on them), despite being released when that very same genre was still in its infancy. It stands tall as apparent 'kid' fare that's far more mature than most 'adult' - or, at least, 'teen' - stuff being produced even today (over ten years after its release). It's effortlessly enjoyable and wonderfully conceived. Really, it's just incredible. 9/10",

                "It's tough to be a superhero and not be allowed to manifest your prowess due to a lawsuit which has made you go into a \"superhero protection program\" and live the life of an Average Joe.This is the case of Bob Parr, Mr. Incredible as he is also known. Living in marital complacency in suburbia with his wife Helen, also known as Elastigirl and his three kids, he works as a mindless office drone who needs to support his family and occasionally gets together with his buddy Lucius Best/Frozone and tries to fight small crime.Until one day when he gets called on a special assignment in a remote location which leads him smack into the lair of a former fan, now turned arch-nemesis, Syndrome, who has an interest in destroying the world and also destroying his family.What could have been a by-the-numbers story is enhanced by much of the \"performances\", or rather, the way the characters are made to interact to one another as per the screenplay. Bob and Helen are clearly in love even though their glory years as superheros (they believe) are over. Bob frets that he's become this paunchy bear of a man, Helen now has to multi-task since she is raising three children, each with a personality of their own, each with superpowers of their own.I find it interesting to see how their kids also are given distinct personalities: Dash has the restless spark that his superpowers will require him to have and Violet is as close to channeling Lydia Dietz from Beetlejuice as possible -- shy, goth, and starting to develop her powers of invisibility and create force fields but beset by feelings of insecurity. Even Jack-Jack, the baby, has his moments, mainly caused by typical baby tantrums and in a crucial point, sheer fear. And this is where the script works: it never forgets that they are essentially kids who have these powers and would treat them as any kid would.Brad Bird has in his hands an excellent, humanized tale of superheroes that borrows liberally from the Fantastic Four and takes it into an Ozzie and Harriet setting. He's created a movie that is tricky: while animated, it has some elements that will not be understood or suitable for children, such as Bob Parr going through his identity crisis, for example. At the same time, this is the first time that a film has broken grounds in its background animation. While the people are seen as cartoons, the locations are something else and have the look and feel of actual scenery. It's the first time water looks like water; that made me almost feel like reach out and touching the screen.Much of the credit in establishing the characters are the voices used. Craig T. Nelson brings a beautiful masculinity to Bob Parr who would probably resemble bodybuilder Jeramy Freeman. Holly Hunter's voice makes Helen spunky, resourceful, feminist but devoted at the same time. Samuel L. Jackson brings his own star power into Lucius Best and the scenes involving his wife at a tense moment is side-splitting and cheerfully stereotypical. And what Bird himself does with his own rendition of Edith Head is nothing short of camp heaven.In short, excellent family entertainment with a smart spin on what becomes of superheros once their fifteen minutes of fame are over.",

                "Spoilers herein.All movies are about other movies. Most simply quote them, and most of these are bad. Some are very clever quoters, like Tarantino. But still mere quoters. A few weeks ago, I saw 'Van Helsing' which impressed the daylights out of me. It was all about transmutation at many levels including transmuting itself through several other movie identities.Meanwhile, I've been impressed by Pixar for other reasons. They've always been the leaders in folding and introspective dimensionality. Their logo even shows it: an illuminator jumps on the 'i', replaces it, looks around and then looks directly at you.In this film, their introspective experiments extend to quoting other films. But instead of the simple shopkeeping of Tarantino, we have appearances of other films but instead of being quoted they are re-imagined. Each transmutation is better than the original: This is better Bond than Bond, better Spy Kids than Spy Kids, better family drama than any recent experience. Better through-the-trees chase than Star Wars. Much, much better than 'Spiderman' and its ilk because it really understands pacing and manages ever-more unseen camera swoops.And it does everything it does with familiar images. For instance, the scene where Bob smacks his boss through several walls and he ends up wrapped in bandages and in traction is a collection of classic images from old cartoons, starting with the big guy grabbing the little guy. Except you don't notice that the big guy is the good guy. Never happens in the classics.There are two interesting folds here: the one that folds many movies genres as we mentioned and the one that conflates the folds of reality. Here's how this works: Usually there are two layers of a folded movie: the movie and some more abstract story within the movie. Spoofs depend on you knowing the layers, even if a layer isn't shown. So 'Austin Powers' has the intermediate level of Bond, even though it doesn't have an explicit segment that exists in the world of Bond. Ted's law says the folding distance must be equal, so the abstraction between the real world and that of Bond is exactly the same as that between Powers and Bond, extra cartoonishness if you wish.This Pixar project has two levels squashed into the same world. One level is the very realistically abstracted story between Bob and Helen. This isn't very cartoonish at all compared the regular world of cartoons. Then you have the superhero world which Bob and later Helen dive into; this is the most extremely abstract world of cartoons. Three levels, us, Bob and Helen as people (and they seem more real in this mode than most 'real' characters) and Bob and Helen and kids as superheros.The novelty of the fold is that these are squashed together as if there is no distance. That (plus some very human-like camera angles and the 'interview' footage at the beginning) squashes the world of the viewer into what we see. Its the kind of brilliant novelty that can only be done by close students of the art.A side comment that follows: the standard Disney cartoon has to have an obvious moral. Parents enthusiastically use this as a sad excuse for parenting. This film puts the moral in the spoof level. That means, folks, that it is equating it to the mediocre fictions Bob berates at the beginning. To distract the dopes in the audience, they do damage control by splicing an 'ordinary' moralistic dippy thing at the beginning.The real moral is that most movie houses have 'insurance:' they test their films into mediocrity. Pixar does no testing. They figure it out and trust their geniuses. Along the way, they take two heavy hits in the story at insurance companies who literally put superstars out of business, and incidentally steal from the worthy.

                "I am tired of reading reviews about how an animated film is too violent for children, deals with mature issues like segregation or death, or is simply \"too grown up\" for small children. Since when did we decide to water down the truth for children, and when exactly are they old enough for certain issues, and why is it animation means it's suppose to be for children. Animation has allowed movie makers to break molds, has allowed them to do things that could not be done with regular actors or locations. We use CGI to accomplish effects we otherwise couldn't do, why is the art of illustration not considered on the same level as the art of computer graphics? I don't feel that just because something is made for children it should be dumbed down and I don't believe that an adult is too superior to watching something that is animated. Stories geared toward children such as Aesop's Fables or the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Anderson, were told to teach life lessons; don't cry wolf, be happy with what you have and don't trust strangers. These are lessons, and stories, that were not watered down, that showed to what evil depths greed, slothfulness and envy, just to name a few, could take hold of in a person.The Incredibles does not shy away from being real; it has an amazing message for both adults and children. The message I saw over and over again in the movie but could not find in a single review was how society was oppressing people to be no better than someone else. We seem to be headed towards embracing mediocrity, Harrison Bergeron, the short story by Kurt Vonnegut that was later turned into a film with Sean Astin, is the perfect example of someone smart being held back because it would hurt the dumb kids feelings to know there was someone better than them. The Incredible's attacks this head on, in one scene the villain Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee), who has no real super powers but invents rocket shoes and remote controlled robots, tells Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) that he plans on killing all the truly empowered people and, using his inventions, become the only super hero until he's had his fun, at which time he will sell his inventions allowing everyone to become special \"which of course means no one will be\".Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have three children. Daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) can make herself invisible but only uses it to hide from a boy she likes, she's been broken down in spirit to feel like there is something horribly wrong with her and that she should be ashamed for being empowered with this amazing gift, to her it is a curse. Violet's younger brother Dash (Spencer Fox) on the other hand is angry with not being allowed to play in sports, because of his super speed, even though he promises not to show off. Their character development is some of the most in depth I've seen for \"children\" in a film, in part because it's real, they face death and failure and they rise above their shame and anger to become real heroes.This movie is funny, it was honest, and it was one of the best films of the year. There is real development, there are real issues and real messages and at the end of the film I wanted to find the super hero in myself.

Some aspects are clearly aimed at the adult viewer such as obvious references to James Bond, these are done in a way that people who don't see the reference won't get the impression that they are missing something.The film opens fifteen years ago in a world where superheroes routinely fight crime and protect the population... until the population is fed up with paying to repair all the damage they do while fighting crime. Banned from using their powers they are forced to hie their super powers and live regular lives. Back in the present Mr Incredible is working in an insurance office by day and sneaking off with his old friend Frozone to fight crime by night... while his wife Helen, formally Elastigirl believes he is just bowling. After one such outing he is contacted by the mysterious Mirage who offers him a chance to use his powers again in service of the government. He thinks he can hide this from his wife but she spots that his costume has been repaired and contacts the designer Edna 'E' Mode who tells her that not only did she repair it but also made him another. Helen goes to see her and while there learns that her husband has been captured; she must go to his rescue, accompanied by their two children who stowed away on her plane... luckily they have powers that will help rescue their father from Syndrome, his former number one fan who has gone somewhat insane and makes up for his own lack of powers with an array of gadgets.Pixar did a great job making this film, making the characters feel believable even though they are animated superheroes. The story was fairly gripping and there was a sense of danger... we were shown that Syndrome had already killed several other \"Supers\". Some parents might not be too keen on the fact that some people die, including a few in an amusing scene about the dangers of wearing a cape, none of these deaths are likely to scare children though.

                "\"The Incredibles\" is by far and away the most mature and engaging Pixar film to date. This movie is nothing less than a display of sheer brilliance to an utmost prestigious level that proves the genius in director Brad Bird (\"The Iron Giant\"). From the perfectly created characters to the witty and humorous dialog involved, \"The Incredibles\" is the ideal film for true fans of the animation and/or comic book genre. It doesn't fail to provide viewers of with a fragment of every genre; incredible animation, action, and even a bit of drama. However, the aspect most evident in \"The Incredibles\" that was frequently credited for the success of its predecessors was the emotional aspect. The thesis on midlife crossroads on personal and professional dilemmas was well presented.Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) seems an average guy who works in an insurance agency, and lives a \"normal\" mediocre life with his wife Helen and three kids: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. But there's more to it, actually. Bob used to be Mr. Incredible, and Helen was Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), two of the world's greatest crime fighters until a series of lawsuits have forced superheroes to adopt civilian identities. But when Bob receives a mysterious call that has him for a top secret assignment, he sees this as an opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again. He accepts the mission but soon discovers that it is a trap of a nemesis from way back, and the whole family eventually has to to join him to fight evil and save the world.What we have here is something that unfortunately becoming quite a rare thing nowadays: an example of a truly brilliant animation. As I have said, not only does it have some of the most phenomenal computer graphics and action sequences ever committed to film, but like all the best movies it also has the heart to support the movie between the adrenaline-pumping moments. The main reason for this is the great characterization. \"The Incredibles\" may contain a little too much of violence that may be better suited for older children than the younger ones. Yet one cannot easily discount the family themes and comic episodes, with characters like superhero-costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird) and Bob's friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) providing ample support. Another is that the film, as is with previous Pixar films, is effective in the use of computer generated images (CGI) which is a major plus for moviegoers. The details in which the animators for the film present are awe-inspiring and breathtaking. The music also pasted itself impeccably with the atmosphere Bird has created for the film. Very retro.It is a demonstration of precision and excellence, created by the brilliance and meticulous mannerisms of the director. It goes beyond an animated movie and is without a doubt one of the best animations of all time. It is truly incredible to see a film like this.",

                "Okay, by now, it's unanimous that Pixar's \"The Incredibles\" is a great family film. So why add another review? It's not because I think I'll say anything that a plethora of other reviewers hasn't already said, but because I feel the ~need~ to say that this is a great family film.Too many movies barely pass for family films these days. They oftentimes contain elements and themes to which we do not wish to have our children exposed. They even, more often than not, contain messages or morals with which we do not agree and find awkward or inappropriate to explain to our children. They even promote lifestyle choices, hereditary and/or cultural differences, or unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions and still pass for family films.This is not one of those movies. The Incredibles is wholesome, witty, and clever, while appealing to all ages. You can't say that about many movies, especially today.All in all? This is a great movie, anytime you want a movie you don't mind your grandparents or young children watching. Plus, it's fun and does not fail to entertain.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",

        "synopsis": "It is about May of 1948 in a small northern Florida town. As the film opens, Lucas Jackson (Paul Newman) is using a pipe cutter to cut the tops off of parking meters. He is drinking, possibly drunk, but not violent. When the police arrive, he is peacefully arrested.\nLuke and three other men arrive at a rural Florida prison where they serve on a road gang performing hard labor. When he arrives at the prison, the warden reads his record. He remarks that Luke had been in the Army, attained the rank of Sargeant, was awarded several medals, but was discharged as a private. Something he did got him busted back down to the same rank at which he entered the Army. Luke is sentenced to two years.\nDragline (George Kennedy) is clearly the leader of the prisoners. He is uneducated and illiterate, but smarter, stronger, bigger, and does not hesitate to exercise his power over them. Most of the prisoners willingly submit to Dragline, but Luke does not. There is no open opposition to Dragline, just a casual refusal to change his behavior in order to please others. Nevertheless, Dragline sees this as a threat to his power and dominance.\nThe men leave at sunset and perform over 12 hours daily of grueling hard labor under intense heat and humidity on the side of the road cutting grass with a sickle or shoveling dirt. One of the new prisoners passes out the first day and another one tries to get out of the detail by sweeping, which was a trick played on him. Luke makes it the first day, but exhausted and barely able to get back into the truck.\nAt the end of the first day for the new men, Alibi, the one who tried to get out of the hard labor by sweeping, is made to sleep in the box the first night, a cramped isolation unit outside to learn a lesson to not challenge the guards.\nAfter Luke says something that Dragline takes as a challenge to his authority, Dragline arranges for he and Luke to have a boxing match. Being much larger, Dragline simply pounds Luke into a pulp, but Luke will not give up, or stay down on the ground. What begins as a boxing match with enthusiastic prisoners and guards watching slowly turns into a sad spectacle. Prisoners begin to plead with Luke to lay down and refuse to get back up, and eventually Dragline himself pleads with Luke to simply stop fighting back, but Luke will not stop. The prisoners begin to walk away, unable to watch the sad scene any longer. Dragline himself wants the fight to end, and at one point has to catch the beaten and exhausted Luke from falling down, carrying him across his shoulder and gently setting him on the ground, only to have Luke use what little strength he has left to tap Dragline with one last punch. Finally, even Dragline cannot continue. The only men who are still watching are the guards and the warden, but the warden seems concerned about Luke's stubbornness and the guards remain indifferent.\nLuke becomes the prisoners' hero, and even Dragline is now respectful of Luke during a card game that night of having tricked a fellow opponent on betting with a bad hand dealt, giving him the name \"Cool Hand Luke.\"\nOn the chain gang, Luke encourages the other prisoners, by his own attitude and energy, to excel at their menial tasks. This not only encourages camaraderie among the prisoners, it deprives the guards of a stick to hold over the prisoners' heads. The prisoners are forced to shovel sand over a freshly tarred road, and they perform the job so quickly and with such a sense of competition that they complete the job early, and thus by default earn a few hours of relaxation, because there is no more road on which to work.\nOn a Sunday, Luke's mother comes to visit him, visibly ill and dying of cancer or emphysema and still chain-smoking, and it is clear that Luke gets his independent streak from her. He admired her ability to live life on her own terms, and has tried to emulate that, but with much different results.\nDuring one very hot and rainy night, Luke decides out of the blue that he can eat 50 eggs. Most of the other prisoners oppose and that it's impossible or will kill him, but Dragline begins to take bets. Luke barely succeeds at it and collects all the money from bets. Soon after, Luke receives a telegram that his mother has died.\nThe warden uses the death of Luke's mother as an excuse to lock him in \"the box,\" solitary confinement in a hot wooden shed. The warden claims that men will often run away when their relatives die, so he locks Luke up until after Luke's mother is buried. This has the opposite effect, and Luke promptly escapes after being released from solitary.\nLuke is later caught, after mailing a picture and magazine back to his former fellow prisoners. He is double-chained, but escapes a second time. Again, he is recaptured. While Luke is becoming the \"hero\" of his fellow prisoners, it is a role he does not want. He admonishes them to \"stop feeding off me,\" to stop living life vicariously through his acts.\nThe guards and warden determine to break Luke's will. They force him to dig and bury, then re-dig and re-bury, a ditch. He is beaten and tormented, until he finally begs God to spare him from the warden and guards. They take this as a sign that he is finally a broken man, and Luke himself later admits that it did break him.\nA few days later, the guards have now made Luke a trustee. Nonetheless, when he is later given an opportunity, he seizes it and escapes again, stealing one of the prison trucks to make his get-away. This time, Dragline decides to go with Luke. Only later, after their escape, does Dragline weigh out the consequences. He had only two years left on his sentence, but now - if caught - will probably have many more years in prison.\nDragline wants to team up with Luke, but Luke tells him that he wants to go alone. Luke has always been an individual, not a conventional leader, and does not want to take on that role now. Luke goes into a church, after being completely irreverent to God through the entire film, and asks God to help him escape. But the warden and guards arrive, and when Luke mocks them from the church window, he is shot.\nThe local police want to take Luke to the hospital, but the warden insists that they take him back to prison instead. It is clear that Luke will not make it that far, but the warden heads off with Luke in his car. The one guard who always wears sunglasses is attacked by Dragline, and though Dragline is subdued, he managed to take off the guard's mirror-like sunglasses (and the warden runs over them with his car).\nIn the final scene, Dragline is regaling the prisoners with stories of Luke's final moments, and it is clear that Luke is dead. He is the true anti-hero, never wanting to be anybody's role model, just wanting to live life on his own terms. But like the guard's sunglasses, Luke managed to unmask the injustice and hypocrisy of the system in which he was confined. Basically, he gave up his life over a parking meter, but in the final analysis he could not be broken by the system.",

                "Cool Hand Luke (1967) **** (out of 4) Paul Newman plays the title character, a man who just can't reform to the rules in life and can't reform to the rules when sent to a chain gang. This is certainly without question one of my favorite movies and it certainly had a large impact on my life when I watched it as a teenager. I hold this film very close to my heart and especially the character of Luke but even without the personal feelings this remains one of the better movies out there. Some have called it a prison movie but I think that's really an insult because the film is so much more than that including one of the best character studies out there. The film has so many laughs, so many painful moments and so many dramatic moments but I think the true heart of the film is in its honesty towards Newman's character. There are countless great scenes including the legendary egg eating contest but one of my favorites has always been the ending with Newman talking to God inside the church. Needless to say, Newman is brilliant in the role and while it's hard to say which one performance of his is his greatest this one here is awfully close. You can really see Newman sticking his heart and soul into the role and you really can't imagine anyone else playing the character. George Kennedy also deserved his Oscar and Strother Martin makes for one great villain.",

                "Greetings again from the darkness. I went way too many years without watching this movie again, so when Cinemark included it in the summer classic film series, I was in my seat nice and early. Mention this movie and the first thing people do is quote one of the most famous lines in movie history: \"What we have here is failure to communicate.\" No question that's a great line. But there is so much more to this movie and it holds up beautifully 45 years later.Based on the novel by Donn Pearce, who spent two years on a chain-gang, this is the story of Luke (Paul Newman) who just can't bring himself to conform to the rules, regardless whether those be the rules of the military, society, prison, or those self-imposed by the convicts. We are introduced to Luke as he drunkenly cuts off the top of parking meters on main street of a small town. Later, in a throw away line, we learn he was gaining revenge on someone. It's the clear indication that while he doesn't always want to fit in, Luke clearly knows right from wrong.There are so many terrific scenes in this film, that it's not possible to discuss each. Every scene with the prison warden, played by Strother Martin, is intense. Each of the Boss guards are frightening, especially Morgan Woodward as the sharpshooter behind the mirrored shades. There are numerous impactful scenes featuring the group of convicts. Even though we learn little about the individuals, we realize the fragile male psyche is on full display. Despite the power of all of these characters and scenes, the real strength of the film is the relationship between Luke and Dragline (George Kennedy). Watching the early cat and mouse game, and the subsequent transfer of power, feature two amazing actors at the top of their game.George Kennedy rightfully won the Best Supporting Actor award and continued on to become one of the most successful and prolific character actors of the 70's and 80's, and his career culminated with his iconic role in the Naked Gun series. As for Paul Newman, this is one of his best performance in a long line of standout performances. This one is in the middle stage of his career and he exuded manliness with a touch of sensitivity. He and Strother Martin would meet again in one of the best sequences of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Watching Luke win over all the convicts, including the previous leader played by Kennedy is stunning, yet gut-wrenching when offset by the scenes with the guards who are hell bent on getting Luke to understand his place. They understand the risk he poses to the systematic rhythms of the prison.The supporting cast is downright incredible. This was the feature film debut for: Ralph Waite (4 years later he became the beloved paternal figure of TV's The Waltons); Joe Don Baker(Buford Pusser from Walking Tall); James Gammon (later the crusty manager in Major League); and Anthony Zerbe, another iconic character actor of the 70's and 80's. Also featured are Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton (singing a few songs), Wayne Rogers (from MASH), Richard Davalos (James Dean's brother Aron in East of Eden), and Rance Howard (Ron's dad as the sheriff). In a brief, but truly great scene, Jo Van Fleet (also from East of Eden), appears as Arletta, and we quickly understand Luke's background.Often overlooked by film historians, \"Lucille\" putting on a show for the convicts as she washes her car, is a scene that is meant for more than titillation. As she creatively buffs the windows, the reaction of the convicts reminds us that these are still men and no amount of humiliation and degradation can change that. One of my friends argues that Joy Harmon was clearly cheated out of an Oscar for this scene.The score is the handy work of Lalo Schifrin and expertly captures the moment ... especially in the black top scene. Director Stuart Rosenberg was known only for his TV work when he got this script. He went on to direct another prison movie in 1980 called Brubaker. Starring Newman's Butch Cassidy co-star Robert Redford, the film was a decent prison drama, but not at the level of Cool Hand Luke ... which by the way, was installed into the National Film Registry in 2005.",

                "This film got me from the first frame to the last. It's not even because of the story (which I love, of course) - it's just so very well made. And so modern. The kind of angles and perspectives the camera uses, the way it zooms in and out or even allows itself (literally) to get dirty - the way this whole picture was shot is just something I haven't seen in an American film released prior to this one. And yet, although it is considered a classic, when people talk about the \"New Hollywood\" somehow 'Cool Hand Luke' is hardly ever mentioned - despite the fact that it came out only a couple of months after 'Bonnie and Clyde' in 1967 and before 'The Graduate'. I look at this film mainly as a character study but the story arc also works very well and it hasn't aged a bit. This is one of those rare films that was way ahead of its time and which has simply everything: great acting, iconic characters and scenes, wonderful music - and the cinematography is just unbelievable. Funny, tragic and moving, 'Cool Hand Luke' is one hell of a film. What we've got here is NOT failure to communicate - but a 10 star masterpiece.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

                "On the face of it, Cool Hand Luke tells a simplistic story about a guy who breaks the law and is sent to a rural prison, where he must earn status among the prisoners. This in turn sets him against the guards and governor, who want nothing better than to knock him down, and the plot goes from there.Where this film excels is in its depth. It can be read in a number of different ways, from example as a religious allegory and also in terms of status and power in the modern age. In essence there's a microcosm of society inside the prison with each character fulfilling a different role or tier. Paul Newman plays the classic rebellious character, a man unwilling to conform, ever, and he does it in such a brilliant way that I'm surprised he didn't win his Oscar.Newman's the perfect fit for the part: upbeat, funny, and incredibly sympathetic. I haven't seen all of his films, but I find it hard to imagine he could better his role here. Equalling him is George Kennedy, also at his best, and fully deserving his best supporting actor Oscar. His character is perfectly written and, indeed, this film is perfectly made, with great attention to visual detail throughout. It's also notable for featuring a number of classic sequences, from the egg eating to the 'Plastic Jesus' song and of course the escape attempts. A fantastic film indeed.",

                "Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce's novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke, it was with great anticipation that I awaited it's transfer to the big screen.  I was not disappointed.Cool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn, but it is so much more than that.  It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into.  When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters, his explanation to the prison captain(Strother Martin) is \"Small Town, not much to do in the evening\", which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid.  Later, to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer, but importantly adds \"just settlin some old scores\".  It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property.  As a service man, we also discover that Luke won a bronze star, achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private.  Again, early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body's rules but his own. Yet, we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong.  At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances, he tells the boss, \"calling it your job don't make it right, Boss.\"  In a visit from his mother Arletta(Jo Van Fleet), Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her, \"A man's got to go his own way\" or as he also puts it, \"I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can't seem to find no elbow room\". As Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years, we meet the other inmates.  Some of them wear chains, some of them do not.  It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg, emphasizes.  We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform.    You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to, or they will find the means to get you to walk the line.  As the Captain reiterates, \"for your own good, you'll learn the rules\" A point driven home often.What we discover about their crimes is minuscule.  One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car, another is a paper hanger, another new inmate is charged with breaking, entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us.  It enables to view these prisoners as men, and while we don't feel any genuine sympathy for them, feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce's story, and Luke as the focal point.\nBecause of his individuality, it doesn't take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates.  It is not a role he chooses, or even wants.  It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others.  He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship, and would be just as happy if he didn't have to deal with it.  He is still trying to find his way in the world, and if there is any real purpose for his existence.Another principal character is Dragline(George Kennedy).  It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten.  Dragline's admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that he(Dragline)has learned the rules on how to get by, but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process.  He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm.  I can't remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in, and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.Cool Hand Luke is not without it's humorous moments especially in the  early going.  It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages.  Perhaps, for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke's dilemma.In translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson, has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen.  Lalo Shifrin's memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang.  Director Stuart Rosenberg made more good films after Cool Hand Luke, but in my opinion never achieved the same degree of perfection that he does here.   As Cool Hand Luke, Paul Newman give one of the most memorable performances in a long distinguished career.  It is not an easy task portraying a man who travels the road from being a sincere individualist, to a man who may be beaten and defeated, yet in the end is still unwilling to accept that fate. Although Rod Steiger won the best actor award that year, one could argue that Newman's role was more difficult, as it required substantially different subtle ranges in character.  As for the failure of Cool Hand Luke to achieve a Best Picture nomination, I'm at a loss to explain that malfunction, especially when the likes of Doctor Doolittle and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, far lesser efforts than this were nominated.Cool Hand Luke is a true classic in every sense of the word.  It is a film that will long be remembered.My grade: A+",

Stuart Rosenberg directs \"Cool Hand Luke\". The plot? Paul Newman plays Luke Jackson, a young drifter who returns home after WW2. Luke's been dealt one bad hand after the next, and, no matter how he plays his cards, always seems to lose. The film opens with Luke, drunk and shameless, knocking the heads off parking meters. The authorities try to cash in on our everyday movements, and this lack of freedom ticks Luke off. The poor guy just wants to be free, man.After being arrested, Luke is sent to a Florida prison. What then unfolds is one of the greatest existential movies of all time. Luke's experiences, his conversations with God, his isolation and alienation, and a pair of profound scenes, both involving his mother, elevate \"Cool Hand Luke\" above most prison-break movies.Of course this period saw a number of strong prison flicks (\"The Great Escape\", \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"King Rat\", \"Birdman of Alcatraz\", \"Papillon\", \"Cuckoo's Nest\", \"The Hole\", \"Escape from Alcatraz\", \"A Man Escaped\", \"Riot in Cell Block 11\" etc), but \"Cool Hand Luke\" takes a far more mythical stance. We don't know much about Luke. He's held at a distance, never looks anyone in the eyes when speaking and always has a sly grin on his face. And yet behind his smile we sense deep pain, though its a pain matched by a dogged spirit to continue fighting. Interestingly, whilst a film like \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" had a system that despite its flaws genuinely tried to heal and help others, Luke's social institution is corrupt and in many aspects pointless. Still, for a while Luke abides by it. He goes about the state's business with a smile, cutting grass and paving roads. He only has 2 years in chains. He can make it. And like he says, he has no place else to go. No plans. He plays his cards with cool, detached ambivalence.In one beautiful scene, Luke's dying mother comes to visit. What follows is a touching conversation, she informing us that tried her best with Luke, giving him nothing but love. And yet, no amount of motherly affection has helped her family. Because of this, she says, she \"wishes mankind were like dogs\". She wishes she could abandon her children and forget about them, never having to worry or fret about how they are, what they'll do or where they'll go. Of course she loves Luke, but hates the agony he puts her through. And yet we sense that she understands him intimately. Perhaps she admires him because she too has been dealt a life of bad hands.Luke's outlook changes when his mother dies and the prison warden locks him in a box for no particular reason. When the Boss says \"Just doing my job\", Luke replies \"That don't make it right.\" From here on Luke begins to fight back. He refuses to spend his life on his knees and refuses to submit. The film then becomes a tale of resistance and idolatry. The other inmates quickly begin to idolise Luke, worshipping his never-give-up spirit. But rather than fight themselves, they sit back and exalt Luke, relying him to personify their own desires. Luke begins to resent this. \"Step feeding off me!\" he yells. But they're content to sit on the sidelines. He's a one man revolution, and like many revolutionaries is praised for his stance from afar but never actively supported. Why do men have to die for causes before we take notice?The film ends on an ambiguous note, in which Luke may or may not be riddled with bullets. Does Luke smile? Does he die? Does he survive? If he does survive, is his survival merely wishful thinking on the part of his fellow inmates? Note that the film's final image is a brief shot of a photograph. It was established in an earlier sequence that this idyllic photograph represents a lie. We also know that the photograph's image was staged and that the photograph itself was torn to shreds earlier in the film. The ending thus suggests that though Luke has died and the system utterly beaten him down, the men nevertheless choose to believe in him. They believe he has risen - indeed, the film is filled with Christian imagery) - that he's survived death and still fighting the fight, sticking it to the man for all of mankind.But like that photograph, the inmate's belief is an illusion. Luke is dead, and though his fighting spirit remains in the hearts of these men, it will take something larger to wake them up and shake them out of weak surrender. In the end, \"Cool Hand Luke\" suggests something almost contradictory: that hope must be held onto lest we submit, but that such hope, fuelled by a kind of mythologising and shared delusion, is precisely what engenders submission. 9/10- An accidental masterpiece. The planets really lined up for this one. The only flaw is an overly silly (though iconic) car wash scene.Worth multiple viewings.",

To me, as much as I do like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cool Hand Luke is my favourite movie of this great actor. What of Newman himself? Well he is just superb here, very cool and charismatic as well as the skills he is best at. The cinematography is also a delight, the Technicolour is just stunning, and Stuart Rosenberg's direction is a career-best. The dialogue is crisp and memorable, and the story is beautifully constructed. As for any memorable scenes, the prologue and the egg-eating scene are classics, the film succeeds adeptly at being a character study and I for one had no problem with the religious symbolism. Lalo Schifrin's music is very nice too. So all in all, if you love Paul Newman, you will love Cool Hand Luke. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

                "Truly a memorable movie, and more than just a documentary about southern road gangs. It's a study on the theme of the indomitability of the human spirit in the face of oppression. I was about to name this as Newman's finest performance until I thought of Eddy Felsen in \"The Hustler\" and Frank Galvin in \"The Verdict\"; it's impossible to choose among such a cornucopia of acting achievements, but Luke is right up there (the analogy to Luke as Christ becomes a tad heavy-handed when we see him, at the close of the egg-eating scene, stretched out, arms outward, feet crossed, as if crucified; none the less, it's a powerful image). There is no doubt, however, about George Kennedy as Dragline; it is his finest achievement, and fully deserves the Oscar he got for Best Supporting Actor. It is also fascinating to find so many familiar faces among the inmates - actors such as Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Joe Don Baker, Ralph Waite. and Wayne Rogers - who would go on to fame in their own right. This movie can unquestionably be called a classic. American Movie Classics just started (11/2000) showing a beautifully restored letterbox version which shows it in all its glory.",

                "The rebel character in Hollywood after the death of James Dean went through a period of transition and did not gain definite new characteristics until the late sixties...The three established rebel/anti-heroes in movies were Paul Newman, Warren Beatty, and Steve McQueen...In 1967, screen audiences were exposed to two new rebel hero characters, Clyde Barrow, a rebel without a cause with enough guts to strike out against any bank, and Luke Jackson, an anti-hero 'born to lose,' but a man full of pride and dignity...\"Cool Hand Luke\" resumes Newman's career as another rebel, a non-conformist, a perfect hero who beats the system wherever...Superbly directed by Stuart Rosenberg, Newman exhibits a complete arrangement of emotions invading every nuance and implication... Resources of his true command of his technical acting are breathtaking in their impact... The motion picture (nominated for 4 Academy Awards) won him his 4th Academy Award nomination... Newman is again a cynical loner, but he's also charming, and everything is calculated to involve us with him; like \"Hombre,\" the film begins and ends with closeups of his face, but here, appropriately, he has an engaging smile\u0085 The opening, where he drinks beer, unscrews tops from parking meters and mumbles to the arriving cop, recalls Dean's drunken incoherence at the start of \"Rebel Without a Cause\"\u0097an apt title for Luke\u0085 He breaks rules for no apparent reason, wherever he is, including the chain gang to which he's sentenced\u0085 Unlike Paul Muni in \"I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,\" who steals only to eat and is turned by society into a hardened criminal, Luke is a criminal from the start, and his crime isn't motivated by hunger\u0085 It's a meaningless anti-authority gesture\u0097the existentialist \"gratuitous act,\" committed purely for the sake of committing it\u0085 Luke engages our sympathy not because he is economically deprived or the product of an unhappy home, but because for him the act of rebellion is its own justification: he's the perfect sixties hero\u0085Initially, Luke alienates the prisoners by his indifference and sarcasm, and the top dog, Dragline (George Kennedy) picks a fight with him\u0085 Luke is severely beaten but keeps fighting, and this\u0097plus his continual defiance of the guards\u0097wins him the men's respect\u0085 Their admiration grows when he proves he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs, one after the other, in only one hour, another gratuitous act (\"somethin' to do\"). But Luke gradually becomes a victim of the excessive admiration, rebelling because they expect him to, which leads to a pattern of escapes and captures\u0085 As the warden says, \"What we got here is a failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach.\" Even though Luke becomes subservient after torture, he again escapes\u0085 Dragline admires the way he fooled the guards while planning all along to escape\u0085 But Luke says he really did break down, and asserts: \"l never planned anything in my life.\" Even his last act is motivated not by heroism but by impulse\u0085The physical punishment Newman's characters often undergo reaches an extreme here, as Luke constantly invites pain (in his fight with Dragline, he says, \"You're gonna have to kill me.\"). Underlying his sometimes vigorous rebelliousness is despair at a cruelly indifferent world\u0085 But the men need a hero, and Dragline perpetuates the myth, telling them that he had \"that Luke smile\" to the very end\u0085 We last see a montage of shots of Luke smiling\u0097the men's vision of him as unbeaten and almost immortal\u0085 Newman's performance is among his best, and Luke is one of his definitive studies of non conformism\u0085 As in \"Hombre,\" he underplays, but in a loose, relaxed, \"cool\" manner\u0085 He's affecting in a wide range of moods: quiet detachment, wry contempt, raw courage, exhaustion, exuberance, gentleness, anger, resignation\u0085 There's a superb1y understated scene in which Luke's dying mother (Jo Van Fleet) visits him\u0085 Like Rocky Graziano, he says he tried to live cleanly, but could never find a way\u0085 But the mood is quite different here: instead of intense emotion, there are on1y ingenious expressions of uneasiness, regret, sadness, acceptance\u0085 Newman conveys his unspoken affection entirely through his glances and reactions, as she wistfully remarks that she once had high hopes for him\u0085 The actor even survives the film's pretentious attempts to make him a mock-Christ figure\u0085 Besides the obvious sacrifice-resurrection parallel, he's even shown in the exact crucifixion position following his fifty-egg (Last Supper?) ordeal\u0085 There are two badly conceived dialogs with a God he doesn't believe in\u0097after which he realizes, \"l gotta find my own way,\" a rather unconcealed statement of existential despair\u0097but Newman performs them with quiet conviction\u0085. His mock religion is better suggested by the bottle opener he wears in lieu of a religious medal\u0085 And the despair is effectively dramatized in his reaction to his mother's death\u0085 The men leave him by himself, and he sits on his bed, playing the banjo\u0085 With a sad, breaking voice, he sings a religious parody: \"l don't care if it rains or freezes, long as 1 got my plastic Jesus\u0085\" He looks down and begins crying, but sings faster, obsessively, withdrawing into himself and expressing his utter loneliness in a world that has no God\u0085 It's one of the most moving scenes in all of Newman's work\u0085Paralleled to \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" \"Cool Hand Luke\" is a character study, which works beautifully, very well-made with sense of graphic imagery and cinema view, a good-looking film with superb photography in Color, extremely good as an entertainment...",

                "Perhaps one of the last of the chain-gang movies (until it was briefly shown in the beginning of 2000's \"O, Brother Where Art Thou?), this has always been (1) an interesting film (2) a wonderfully photographed movie.You hear more about the story and about Paul Newman than you usually hear about the cinematography, but it's good and this movie should be seen in widescreen. It was offered as such even on VHS.When I looked at this film sometime in the '90s, I was surprised that the famous line from it: \"What we have here is a failure to communicate,\" was only used twice, and the second time being the last sentence uttered by Newman. I had thought that Strother Martin had said it several times. Boy, Martin was one of the more effective villains in some 1960s film, a mean-talking sadistic guy.This movie was another of the pioneers in promoting a new thing on screen: the \"anti-hero,\" so it was popular in the protest decade of the '60s. Newman's character fit right into the period where the rebel is the hero and the authority figure is the bad guy. You've seen this repeatedly ever since, although filmmakers have always loved rebels.George Kennedy gives Newman memorable support as \"Dragline\" and was aptly awarded for his performance. Someone who I always remembered was the prison guard who said nothing, just stared through his sunglasses. I can always picture that guy and those reflective glasses.

                "One of the reasons that the late 60s/early 70s was such a powerful era in filmmaking is the emergence of the anti-hero (defined as an individual with heroic qualities, but not in a position we would usually find a hero).  This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke'.  We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours.  It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien') live vicariously through him.Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic.

                "Set in the rural south, a man serves time on a chain gang after vandalising parking meters. When inside, he stubbornly refuses to bow down to anybody, be it the prison authorities or his fellow inmates. Soon, though, he becomes a symbol of hope to the other prisoners and his rebellious nature teaches them that their integrity is the most important thing they have.This anti-authoritarian film is very much in a similar mould to Bonnie and Clyde which also came out in 1967. In both of these films the establishment are shown to be the bad guys and the criminals anti-heroes deserving of our sympathy. With this in mind it would only be fair to say that, like Bonnie and Clyde, Cool Hand Luke could be regarded as one of the very first New Hollywood movies. It certainly is a film which indicates that the cinematic norms were changing. It's also one of the first of a new type of prison drama which tried to reach for more authenticity. In many ways it is a precursor to the classic incarcerated-man-against-the-system movie One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). For me, it's not in the same league as that one but it's pretty obviously a very influential work.

Luke Jackson (Paul Newman) is sentenced to a stretch on a southern chain gang after he's arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters. While the avowed ambition of the captain (Strother Martin) is for each prisoner to \"get their mind right,\" it soon becomes obvious that Luke is not about to kowtow to anybody. When challenged to a fistfight by fellow inmate Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke simply refuses to give up, even though he's brutally beaten. Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp -- and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain. Along with stellar performances by Newman, Kennedy, and Martin, Cool Hand Luke features a superb supporting cast, including Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, and Joe Don Baker as members of the chain gang.",

                "'Cool Hand Luke (1967)' was and remains one of Paul Newman's most iconic performances, with the image of Luke Jackson \u0096 with his piercing blue eyes, blissfully carefree smile, dogged determination \u0096 forever entrenched in the minds of all who see the film. Having experienced a lifetime of difficulty and oppression, Luke is one man who never learned to conform to society, and who is willing to sacrifice himself in order to avoid compromising his own integrity. On many occasions, the motivation behind Luke's actions are dubious at best {his numerous escape attempts appear to have been orchestrated for the mere sake of rebellion}, but this all adds to the lure of his enigmatic personality. Many critics have noted the film's scattered Biblical references, with some proposing that Newman's character is an allusion to Christ, who mentored a group of \"disciples\" before offering his own life in the face of tyranny. Directed by Stuart Rosenberg, and wonderfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall {whose final film, 'Road to Perdition (2002)' is among the most beautiful of the new century}, the story of \"Cool Hand Luke\" remains one of cinema's most definitive prison dramas.Influencing, in some way or another, just about every prison movie that followed, and bearing more than a passing resemblance to Milos Forman's masterpiece 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975),' the film's legacy has continued to stretch into the present, and the Captain's (Strother Martin) memorable line \"What we've got here is failure to communicate\" continues to be quoted often. Of course, it is Cool Hand Luke whom we shall always remember so vividly, his nickname representative of his independence, individualism and unwillingness to conform. Newman's superb performance was nominated for an Academy Award at the 1968 Oscars, but he was beaten by an equally-memorable Rod Steiger for 'In the Heat of the Night (1967).' Unthinkably, the film itself was denied a Best Picture nomination, presumably to make way for the epic musical 'Dr. Dolittle (1967),' a childhood favourite of mine that nonetheless should never have been nominated. The picture's single award went to George Kennedy, who is marvellous as Dragline, a tough, imposing but supportive inmate who strikes up a very close friendship with the prison's resident \"messiah.\"",

Picture James Dean doing this part had he lived to do films like these.Newman plays his usual non-conformist rebel type, but he's really a rebel without a cause. He's in his early forties, a Korean war veteran who just hasn't found his place in civilian life. He gets himself busted for no great cause, just on a drunken spree in some Southern town he decides to knock the heads off a bunch of parking meters.That lands him a stint in a county jail with a lot of outdoor work on a road gang. He fights with, but later wins the respect and becomes friends with George Kennedy the head honcho in his barracks.The real tragedy of Cool Hand Luke is that Newman is a failure in life, it's why he's in prison. He gains the respect of his fellow convicts for those ways, but that involves going against the penal system and in the end that gets you nothing. Can you picture James Dean as a forty something doing what Newman is doing? It would have been his kind of role for sure.Newman does a fine job playing the non-conformist Luke who seems to be just going on the path fate has decreed for him. George Kennedy got his Oscar winning career role as Dragline. Other men in Luke's barracks are Wayne Rogers, Robert Drivas, and J.D. Cannon and they fill their roles well.Strother Martin as the warden of the place is the guy with the film's favorite line, \"what we've got is failure to communicate.\" Martin and his correction officers have many interesting ways of getting their point across.Cool Hand Luke may very well be the saddest role Newman ever undertook in his long career.",

                "The many other reviews posted by the time of my writing discuss the plot and other aspects of \"Cool Hand Luke.\" So, I'll just comment on the source of the movie and what I think the aim was in making it. The film is based on a 1965 novel of the same title, by Donn Pearce. The premise for which Luke is jailed and then continues to try to buck the system, escape and then return is ludicrous. Unless one can see that Luke puts life and energy into the prison and his fellow inmates. He is a spark of hope that helps these men survive otherwise monotonous and endless days of drudgery. I don't know if it is that way in the book, but that seems to be the intended drive for the plot in the film. It shows how much difference one person can make \u2013 not just in prison, but in the life of other people wherever they are. Donn Pearce himself spent time in jail and prison. He ran away from home, a suburb of Philadelphia, when he was 15. He lied about his age to get into the Army in 1944, then went AWOL and then turned himself in. He spent 30 days in the stockade. Then, before he got shipped out, the Army learned of his true age (his mother had written a letter) and threw him out. But he was then old enough to join the Merchant Marine, which he did. He served on ships that took him to various European ports and to India. He was caught in France for counterfeiting American money and was imprisoned. He escaped and crossed the Italian border. From there he got forged papers so that he could sign on a ship going to Canada. From Canada, he crossed the U.S. border and revved up his criminal activity. He went into burglary and safe cracking. All of this was by the age of 20. In 1949, he was caught and sentenced to two years on chain gangs in Florida. Pearce began writing stories based on his experiences and the characters he met. His 1965 novel was the first of four. Between books he worked as a freelance journalist. He wrote the screenplay for this movie, and he has a cameo shot in the film as a prisoner named Sailor. In a 2008 bonus video that comes with the DVD of the movie, Pearce says that his character of Luke is partly autobiographical. He says one-third of the character is based on him \u2013 the eating parts and working hard. Another third was based on a real guy named Cool Hand Luke. And the remaining third was just general stuff to tie the two characters together. Director Stuart Rosenberg and Warner Brothers assembled a fantastic cast for the film. Paul Newman is excellent as Luke. George Kennedy is stellar as Dragline, a role that garnered him the Oscar for best supporting actor for 1967. Strother Martin is superb as the Captain of the prison road gang. Many notable stage actors fill the roles of fellow inmates and guards. Lou Antonio is Koko, J.D. Cannon is Society Red, Wayne Rogers is Gambler, Clifton James is floorwalker Carr, Luke Askew is Boss Paul, Robert Donner is Boss Shorty, Charles Tyner is Boss Higgins. This is a highly regarded film that most people should enjoy. Newman and a number of the crew said that this was one of their favorite films to have been in and worked on.",

                "This film is set in America's Deep South in the years after the Second World War. Luke Jackson, a down-on-his-luck war veteran, is arrested for vandalising parking meters while drunk and sentenced to imprisonment in a brutally tough prison. At first his offhand, seemingly arrogant, attitude alienates not only the prison governor and guards but also his fellow-prisoners, and he is soon challenged to a fight by another inmate named Dragline. The tall, powerfully built Dragline is an easy victor, but Luke's determination and fighting spirit, never knowing when he is beaten and refusing to quit, arouse the respect of the others, especially Dragline who becomes his close friend. Luke becomes a hero to the prisoners because they see him as a rebel who refuses to be beaten by the system. (His nickname stems from the cool way in which he plays a hand at poker, but it also refers to his remaining cool in the face of persecution). Luke makes two escape attempts, but on both occasions he is recaptured and brought back to the prison for punishment by the guards who are determined to break his spirit. It seems that they have succeeded, but then Luke and Dragnet make one last break for freedom.On one level this film is a critique of the inhumanity of the American prison system, part of a tradition going back to \"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" and continuing more recently with \"Brubaker\" (also directed by Stuart Rosenberg) and the less successful \"The Last Castle\". The regime in this jail is particularly inhuman. The prisoners are put to work all day digging ditches in the hot sun. (It is never made clear whether the ditches need to be dug and the prisoners are a useful source of free labour, or whether putting them to demeaning and useless work is seen as a means of keeping them under control and of giving vent to the sadistic impulses of their jailers). There is a long list of petty regulations, breach of which is punished by \"a night in the box\", a tiny cell used for solitary confinement. The guards take a perverse delight in tormenting and humiliating the prisoners. Strother Martin's governor (who prefers to be called \"the Captain\") is a particularly frightening figure, a little man with a grating, high-pitched voice who can even make a piece of bland management-speak like \"What we have here is a failure to communicate\" sound like a terrifying threat.The film is more, however, than a social-realist exposure of conditions in America's jails. It was made in the sixties, the decade when the times they were a-changing and when traditional concepts of authority were being challenged everywhere. Like a number of films from the sixties and seventies, \"Cool Hand Luke\" reflects this popular mood. The film with which it has most in common is \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" in which Jack Nicholson does for mental asylums what Paul Newman does here for prisons. Newman's screen persona was often that of the cool, detached outsider. This may have had the effect of narrowing his range as an actor somewhat- he could often seem too laid back in more traditional types of film, such as Hitchcock's \"Torn Curtain\"- but it meant that he could be excellent playing anti-heroes in films of this nature. (\"Hombre\" is another example). Here, in one of his best performances, he makes Luke a symbol of the little man standing up against authority. We learn that he was a hero in the war and was decorated a number of times but that he finished the war as a private after being demoted from sergeant. The implication is that military discipline was as uncongenial to him as prison discipline and that he lost his rank for some act of insubordination. Even his crime can be seen as a protest against the petty tyranny of rules and regulations of which parking meters are a symbol.There has been speculation about the possible religious implications of the film and whether Luke is intended to be a Christ-figure. Certainly, the shot in which he is seen in a crucifix-like pose after the egg-eating contest is derived from standard Christian imagery, but in my view this is not a deliberate Christian allegory along the lines of \"Whistle Down the Wind\" or \"The Omega Man\". In orthodox Christian thought, Christ is much more than a rebel against authority or even a man unjustly persecuted; he is also the Son of God and the Redeemer of mankind. One scene does not an allegory make. Nevertheless, there are undoubted religious overtones to the film. If Luke is an allegorical figure, the allegory is not with Christ but with Everyman, a man in search (sometimes a despairing search) of God. He claims not to believe in God, yet has long conversations with Him. The song he sings after the death of his mother is irreverent, possibly blasphemous, but blasphemy is the sin of the angry believer, not of the unbeliever. A true atheist cannot blaspheme, because there is nothing for him to blaspheme against.Newman was nominated for \"Best Actor\" and George Kennedy won a well-deserved \"Best Supporting Actor\" for his portrayal of Dragline, but I was surprised that the film was not nominated as \"Best Picture\", especially as the nominations in 1968 included a film as weak as \"Dr Doolittle\". Whatever the Academy may have thought, however, \"Cool Hand Luke\" is a film that has matured well. It is a multi-layered film that works well on each of its several levels of meaning. With \"I am a Fugitive\u0085.\" and \"The Birdman of Alcatraz\", it is one of the greatest of all prison dramas. This was Stuart Rosenberg's first feature film, but like Orson Welles (\"Citizen Kane\"), Sidney Lumet (\"Twelve Angry Men\") and Bryan Forbes (\"Whistle Down the Wind\") he made a great film on his first attempt. 9/10",

                "Released in 1967 and directed by Stuart Rosenberg based on Donn Pearce' novel, \"Cool Hand Luke\" is a prison drama starring Paul Newman in the eponymous role as a loner who disdains rules in the early 50s. He is sentenced to two years on a prison farm in Florida run by a stern warden, the Captain (Strother Martin), and guarded by a stoic rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey (Morgan Woodward). Carr (Clifton James) the floorwalker, tells the rules to the new prisoners with violations resulting in spending the night in \"the box,\" a small square room with limited air and little room to move. George Kennedy and Dennis Hopper are on hand as fellow prisoners, amongst many others.I was wondering about the totally stoo-pid reason Luke gets 2 years in prison at the beginning of the film. He likely got a ticket for a \"violated\" parking meter while in town. So he has a few beers, gets his mitts on a big pipe cutter, and thought, \"I'm gonna show these jerks.\"\"Cool Hand Luke\" has a big reputation but, for me, it doesn't quite live up to it. The highlight is the iconic car wash sequence with Joy Harmon, as well as the ending when Luke talks with God about why He made him such a misfit. The rest is a decent prison drama about an eccentric individualist who inspires those around him stuck in the same pen. It's a character study of a likable, impressive, but unruly person who doesn't seem to grasp that getting sloshed and destroying public property has negative repercussions. Gee, maybe you shouldn't try to solve your problems by getting drunk and vandalizing. The movie is realistic and well-made, but generally tedious, although I'm sure that's the point \u2013 being confined on a prison farm WOULD be tedious. The Christ typology is interesting, however; and I can understand how some grade it higher. The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot Tavares & Jacksonville, Florida; and San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, California, with studio work done in Burbank. GRADE: C+ (5.5/10)",

                "Cool Hand Luke is perhaps Paul Newman's most memorable character. He was outstanding as Hud, but he seems to have topped that performance in this 1967 classic.Newman plays a man named Luke. After cutting the heads off some parking meters, he is thrown into a prison system where he's forced to do some hard time tending to country roads. This character has to be one of the biggest enigmas in film history. Luke is likable enough. His mother points out to him that he's even had some good jobs. The viewer is left to ponder why in the heck he can't stay out of trouble.Not much is told about his past. We know he fought WWII, and even won some medals. He has no wife or children to care for. He has a mother who appears to be dying of lung cancer or some such ailment. His other family members seem to hold a grudge against him. We never really learn why he feels the need to cut the heads off the parking meters, but he's caught red-handed. The prison he's sent to makes its inmates work their tails off, but it looks like they'll treat you fairly if you follow their rules. Luke has no intentions of following any rules laid down by the warden or the \"bosses\" that watch over the road work, though.After taking a tremendous beating from the toughest inmate (Kennedy), Luke quickly begins to win the admiration of his fellow prisoners. His spirit catches on with the others, and they begin to get their work done more quickly and effectively than ever before. Things begin to go downhill for Luke once he learns of his mother's passing. He repeatedly tries to escape, and soon the warden and his cronies are out to break his spirit and make him conform. The film becomes a test of wills, and a fascinating character study.The biggest question the viewer is left with is \"why?\". Luke could have simply served out his time and then gone on to a more normal existence. That seems to be out of the realm of possibilities for the character, however. He isn't simply out to impress the other prisoners. At one point he even demands they stop trying to feed off of him for all their strength. Luke seems like a man who simply cannot allow others to tell him how to live. There are a few moments where he openly questions the existence of God, but that angle doesn't go very far. It merely makes the guards want to abuse him even more, but that's about it. It becomes almost frustrating to see this man keep digging a bigger and bigger hole for himself. At one point Luke is forced to literally do just that.What exactly is the film trying to tell us? It doesn't seem to be advocating disobedience. We cheer for Luke when he's causing trouble for the guards, but we feel his pain when they punish him. The film's conclusion is more somber than inspiring.Rosenberg's direction is outstanding, and the supporting cast shines. George Kennedy earned an Oscar for his performance. Overall this is an excellent film not to be missed! 10 of 10 stars from The Hound.",

                "I read another comment on here that said that this and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are two films which are pretty much identical. While I was watching Cool Hand Luke I did recollect the other classic (to me still much more extraordinary) guys-locked-up movie Cuckoo's Nest, as it did have its hero knocking an authority as tough as a ton on bricks. But there's a big difference between the two films- in Cuckoo's Nest, you had in Nicholson a rebel-rouser who didn't mind getting some real words across to people with his plight, and the people he was locked up with are actually, to a basic degree, sane. Newman is, much as the title suggests, 'cool', as he really doesn't have that much dialog for most of the picture, and the system he's bucking isn't supposed to be \"helping\" him and the people he's with. They're there on the chain gang to bust ass and do the work that nobody in their right mind would do unless pointed by a gun to do so. Though on the other hand, this dynamic from Newman, amid a very good prison movie, still makes Cool Hand Luke quite memorable for its ways of bucking the system.It's also by turns an often funny movie, with the centerpiece of the 50 egg bet being one that is just sheerly, unabashedly entertaining. And it's the kind of scene that does almost remind someone of that scene in Cuckoo's Nest where they all get riled up during the 'baseball game' on TV. But sometimes the filmmakers doing Cool Hand Luke do perhaps push a wee bit much allegory on such a simple set of events, less a story, than necessary. At the end of the 50 egg sequence, Newman is basically laid out on the table- and I'm sure it's meant to be intentional- in the form of Christ. This is played up for a lot of the rest of the film, as it's perhaps really intuited that he's suffering for the other prisoner's sins, and may even perhaps someday die for it all. This side ends up becoming a little preachy, even if its meant to be subtle, which I don't think it is, and it detracts from the greater pleasures of watching a picture like this.Because really, aside from the allegory, this is just good old prison picture, and one that pushes the boundaries of the prisoner-escape angle, such as that Newman's Luke escapes for the whole second half of the movie! It's also kind of bittersweet that the filmmakers decide not to show how Newman gets captured, but leaves it at first on the prisoners- who after getting beaten up by Oscar winning George Kennedy's rily character, and getting them to fix a road like its some competition- and then just suddenly he's caught again. At one point this even leads to the now classic line, once sampled in a Guns n Roses song, \"what we've got here is failure to communicate\" by the always great character actor Strother Martin. Though if you're not really looking for message or allegory, it's also just a really neat 'guy' movie, in the best sense of the word, with scenes like the torturous girl-washes-car-in-front-of-chain-gang scene, and of course ones that just show them acting like real guys. It's populated by a plethora of acting talent, with Kennedy, Dennis Hopper, Luke Askew, and even a guitar strumming/singing Harry Dean Stanton! (Which is a hoot if you've seen as mant Stanton films as me).And then finally there's Newman himself, definitely in one of his seminal roles even if it's not a full-on total masterwork. Here he actually does create a character out of someone who is really sort of a nobody with no real aims. He doesn't even know what do to when he breaks out of prison, even as he gets as far as Chicago. \"I never planned anything in my life\", he says at one point. That the character only has maybe 15 lines in the film isn't a problem for Newman either. He makes such a thin character, ultimately, likable and strong, and fulfills such an anti-hero very believably, especially when he's most needed to put up his acting chops towards the end of the picture. Even if you're not too much into prison movies- and this one does have in it the kind of spirit that speaks back to the films of the 30s (in a good way for the old-school fans)- it's worth it just to see what Newman does, alongside the other actors. It also holds up pretty well decades later, which is a credit not just to Newman but to the screenwriters and director Stuart Rosenberg, probably the highlight of an otherwise journeyman filmmaker career.",

                "I first saw \"Cool Hand Luke\" the first week it came out. Went to see it with my father at a theater on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. We were just a few blocks away from the hospital where my Mom was dying of cancer and we just needed a break. It was cathartic. Feeling as beat up and left for dead as I was at the time, I came across a character who knew how to take the punches. \"Luke\" is a beautifully crafted film. Not one wasted frame or moment. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson's screenplay is nothing less than a working man's parable of a truly good soul who just couldn't seem to get a break. In ways, it could be said he truly didn't let himself. But the strength within Luke that would not let him compromise who he was for who he was told to be, the resilience to fight back against those who tried to fight him on that was inspirational. Whether it was a carefully chosen remark or just one of them Luke looks, They knew They couldn't knock him out no matter how badly They knocked him down. Seems he handled life like that, and it was an example I've clung to and have tried to follow in the almost fifty subsequent years. Conrad Hall's cinematography was breathtaking, providing the scope of all the integral parts of the story with the immediacy of all the most intimate moments. Any single frame could hang on your living room wall as the centerpiece. The cast: Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite ... and George Kennedy. Academy Award Winner George Kennedy. \"Dragline\". The most unforgettable \"gentle giant\" I believe I've ever seen on the silver screen. Each and every one of them, in all their glory and in the simplest of nuances, helped raise Paul Newman's masterful portrayal to an ever higher level, maybe his best work ever. The character is very much the story in \"Cool Hand Luke\" and the ensemble brings it to life. Frustrating, challenging, confusing, pain- in-the-ass life with just enough of that rebellious spirit to bring hope to those facing some of their tougher times. I saw the film four more times that first year, and probably twice each year since whenever I could find it. Check in with Luke and the boys for a breath of fresh air and some world-shaking hope. Can't speak for anyone else, but Luke is right up there with Atticus Finch for me when it comes to celluloid heroes, these are the two whose stories got me through some really, really bleak times. And for me, \"Cool Hand Luke\" was ultimately a story of hope. The story of a man who never gave in. Never gave up. And never stopped grinning. All that they piled on him, all they tried to bury him under ... just wasn't worth his getting worked up over. Wasn't gonna get to his spirit.",

His parents have little money and he sleeps on a couch that&#39;s been pushed into the kitchen. His parents bicker constantly and he knows his mother is having an affair. He decides to skip school and begins a downward spiral of lies and theft. His parents are at their wits&#39; end, and after he&#39;s stopped by the police, they decide the best thing would be to let Antoine face the consequences. He&#39;s sent to a juvenile detention facility where he doesn&#39;t do much better. He does manage to escape however.",
            "14-year-old Antoine Doinel is unfairly punished in school by his teacher in French literature. Next morning his friend Ren\u00e9 suggests that they play truant. Instead of going to school, they go to the cinema, play pinball, and visit a huge amusement rotor. The following day Antoine tells his teacher that his absence was due to his mother&#39;s death; unfortunately his parents turn up at school. Antoine loves his mother, but she dislikes him, because he is the result of an episodic intercourse in her youth before she met Antoine&#39;s stepfather. When things get worse, both in school and at home, Antoine runs away. Ren\u00e9 lives in a huge apartment with his rich parents, who won&#39;t notice if Antoine sleeps in Ren\u00e9&#39;s room. To get money Antoine steals a typewriter from his father&#39;s office. The machine is unsellable, so he brings it back to the office, where he is caught by an office janitor. Antoine&#39;s stepfather takes him to the police, who imprison him for vagrancy and theft. A juvenile-court judge sends him to an observation centre in the countryside, from where he runs away, and doesn&#39;t stop until he reaches the sea.",
            "In Paris, early-teen Antoine Doinel always seems to be in trouble. He has a short attention span and is easily distracted, which leads to him doing poorly in school. Some of his problems stem from his home life with his mother, Gilberte Doinel, and his stepfather, Julien Doinel, who is the only father he has ever known as Gilberte and Julien married when Antoine was an infant. When Julien and Gilberte aren&#39;t working, they leave Antoine alone to fend for himself. And even when they are home, they are often arguing and their parenting is inconsistent, leading to Antoine having no clear boundaries. On the most part, Antoine truly believes that his mother does not love him. Those issues for which he is blamed are not always his fault, and many of his contemporaries just don&#39;t get caught as often as Antoine seems to get caught. Even when Antoine tries to do the right thing, he often is not given credit for his efforts, or his efforts lead to a bad result. The former issue is especially prevalent at school, where his teachers just believe that his school work will not be worth a passing grade. In general, punishments have been ineffective in curbing his behavior as he just rebels more against them. Antoine is often supported and/or egged on in his activities by his best friend Ren\u00e9, who often skips school with him. Unless something drastic changes in Antoine&#39;s life, he is destined down a path that will lead to nothing good, which is more problematic as he gets older.",
            "With his inattentive, moody, and emotionally unavailable parents--the unmotherly, Gilberte, and the detached stepfather, Julien--often absent from their cramped Parisian apartment, the fourteen-year-old at-risk youth, Antoine Doinel, feels like a stranger in his own house. Misunderstood, unhappy, and afraid to tell the truth to his parents, Antoine can&#39;t wait to grow up, desperately looking for ways to escape the oppression of his home and school, and become autonomous. As a result, his childish innocence leads him to petty crimes to finance his plans of independence; but, before long, Antoine is caught and put in an observation centre, along with other troubled teens, until others decide his fate. However, even though Antoine knows he&#39;s all on his own, the boy cries for attention, and his only wish is to see the ocean for the first time. Why can&#39;t everyone see the boy&#39;s desperate need for love?"

                "So here it is, the landmark film which ushered in the Nouvelle Vague, introduced Francois Truffaut and his screen persona Antoine Doinel to the world, and changed the direction of cinema for ever.  And an impressive piece of work it is, too.     By 1959 the process of film-making had atrophied (artistically, at any rate).  Stale and stagey artifice was the norm, and for the upcoming generation of film-makers and critics (Truffaut was both) a new way of conceiving cinematic art had to be found.  In this, his feature film debut, Truffaut found it.     This is cinema verite at its freshest and best.  The film looks like a documentary and absolutely drips with kitchen-sink candour.  A handheld camera follows Antoine around his parents' flat and we get to peer in on the grimy, cramped and oh-so-ordinary minutiae of a humble little life.  \"Don't forget the garbage,\" Antoine is repeatedly told, and Truffaut certainly doesn't.  He pulls off with resounding success the seemingly impossible feat of making the mundane seem entirely absorbing.     \"C'est peut-etre un question de glandes,\" suggests a teacher as we see the adolescent Antoine go quietly off the rails.  Paris (or more accurately, that part of Paris bounded by Montmartre and the Gare du Nord) is wintry and stark, the unlovely and prosaic environment in which Antoine functions - or fails to function.  Truffaut wants, inter alia, to deflate the \"April In Paris\" myth so virulent in the 1950's.  He succeeds mightily.  Antoine is disaffected.  Parents, home and school are all inhospitable and the sleety, foggy streets south of Pigalle convey Antoine's alienation admirably.     Deadpan humour is a powerful weapon in Truffaut's armoury.  Antoine's inept note-forging, the outlandish excuse which he gives for his absence and his long-suffering look during his mother's reminiscences are all nicely done and raise a chuckle.  The bird's-eye view of the P.T. class, shot with a rooftop camera, conveys wordlessly the comedy of the rapidly diminishing line of pupils.     A punch and judy show is filmed from inside the performance canopy, looking out onto the audience of small children.  Their total lack of artifice is delightful to see, and underscores Truffaut's point - candour is beautiful, staginess is unacceptable.  As Antoine's father frogmarches him along the street after the typewriter debacle, bemused passers-by stop to stare at the camera.  Not only is this disarmingly honest, it is also profound.  Cinema should exist, as it were, inside the camera, not in elaborate sets.  Antoine rides in the spinning drum at the fairground, the camera fixed rigidly on him, allowing the onlookers to dissolve into an undistinguished blur.  The camera IS Antoine's subjective self.     The performance of 15-year-old Jean-Pierre Leaud as Antoine is astonishingly good.  He is natural and engaging, and his soliloquy (delivered to the psychologist) seems an incredible piece of work for so young an actor.     A long, long tracking shot accompanies Antoine as he runs away from it all, and is intended to convey, by the very rhythm of his breathing, the internal subjectivity of a child who has been let down by his parents and his society.  The final freeze-frame, with no histrionic fireworks, no resounding words and no tidy denouement, closes the film on a note of immense emotional power.  Antoine is alone.",

                "Every day life, however 'real' and gritty it may be, is rarely portrayed on film and was certainly a rarity in the 1950's. In Europe however, there was a movement in film-making that embraced this realism and searched for the deeper meaning in the 'here and now'. This is about the most basic and miniscule portion of the meaning behind the French New Wave of the 1950's \u0096 films that explored the filmmaker's surroundings, and eventually became an inspiration for filmmakers around the world. Francois Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows' is one of the most well-known films of this movement, and has been embraced and hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.After viewing Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows', I have been ruminating over the deeper meaning behind his story of Antoine Doinel, a 14 year old boy in Paris who is having trouble in school and trouble at home. In school, he is marginalized as a trouble-maker, yet it is obvious that it is more a matter of him causing trouble by expressing himself creatively rather than following along with mundane assignments. At home, Doinel has to deal with an adulterous mother who only pays attention to him when it suits her needs, and a father who is barely present. Doinel responds by doing the only thing he feels he can do, and that is by acting up; eventually earning an expulsion from school and being sent to a juvenile prison camp by his parents. Nothing is cut and dry in 'The 400 Blows'. If one were to take the film at face value, there would be a 'so what' feeling. What the film subtly explores is the disenfranchisement of youth. There is no joy in Doinel's life \u0096 anytime he tries to express himself creatively or acts up in a playful way he is shot down and metaphorically forced back into line. This is not a typical Paris street kid either, this is one who reads Balzac for pleasure and conveys intense emotion. The problem is that no one is there to notice or care. Another aspect of the French New Wave was that the films were not merely a product of a Hollywood factory; these were intensely personal films to the writers and directors. In the case of 'The 400 Blows', it is certain that Doinel is based on Truffaut, himself only 28 when he made the film. Truffaut's cinematography in 'The 400 Blows' is exquisite. We see a Paris that is not in Technicolor with colorful fountains like 'An American in Paris'. This is Paris from a Parisian's perspective \u0096 and the difference is breathtaking and intense. These are not Louis XVI style houses, they are tiny flats where people have to sleep in closets and walk up and down six flights of stairs. The city views are those of a native Parisian \u0096 the kind of tour one would get if they asked the average Parisian for non-tourist attractions.There is still a lot that I have to learn and think about 'The 400 Blows' and French New Wave in general, but with the minute amount of understanding I have of it, I found it to be an intense film, one that left me emotional and craving enlightenment. Rarely is there a film that leaves that kind of impact on me, but Truffaut managed to leave me speechless and deep in thought with 'The Four Hundred Blows'.--Shel",

                "THE FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS (Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut - France 1959).Twelve-year-old Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) has troubles at home and at school. Ignored and neglected by his parents, his relationship with his mother is further strained when he discovers that she has taken a secret lover. Added to this, his school teachers have written him off as a trouble maker and, with luck seemingly never on his side, it is Antoine who ends up getting the blame for bad behaviour. Finding refuge only in his love of cinema, Antoine soon finds it necessary to break free and discover what the world can offer outside the confines of everyday life. I have always struggled with the labeling of this film as one of the pivotal entrances in the \"Nouvelle Vague\". Since Jean-Luc Godard's \"Au Bout de Souffl\u00e9\", who uses a completely different approach to film-making, with his restless jump-cutting and endless references to pop culture, Truffaut presents his case clear cut, as realistic as possible. But this was something completely different from the way American films portrayed juvenile delinquency so far. No iconic trouble makers like James Dean or Marlon Brando, just a realistic portrait of a twelve-year old boy sliding into isolation. The very idea alone was something novel, seldom depicted in a way like this. Much of the praise must go to Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, who never even seems to be acting. His every movement, thought, expression come across as completely natural. Truly, one of the most remarkable performances of such a young actor I've ever seen. Watching this over 40 years after it was made, it all looks deceptively simple, with Truffaut's perfect integration of music and image, location shooting on the streets of Paris and the naturalistic performances. Truffaut used many innovations but they are not easily noticeable as in Godard's work. This was for instance the first French film to be shot in widescreen (aspect ratio 2.35:1), which required much planning on Truffaut's part, with some surprising results. In many scenes we don't see the other person Antoine is talking to, which gives the viewer the illusion as if Antoine is almost talking directly to the camera. Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud would continue his role as Antoine in four more films by Truffaut, \"Love at Twenty\" (1962), \"Stolen Kisses\" (1968), \"Bed and Board\" (1970) and \"Love on the Run\" (1979).Camera Obscura --- 9/10",

                "The title of the film is The 400 Blows but it is actually an expression for 'Raising Hell.'Made in 1959 in a cinema verite style. This is the full screen debut of Francois Truffaut and an example of the French New Wave. It was a critical hit.Jean-Pierre Leaud plays Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood teenager in Paris who constantly gets into trouble at school and an at home. Doinel is based partly on Truffaut himself.Doinel finds school boring, does not get on with his teachers who usually catch him telling lies including an embarrassing one where in a panic he tells that one of his parent has died.At home he is alone a lot as both of his parents are working. His glamorous mother (Claire Maurier) seems to have little time for him. He gets on better with his father (Albert Remy) who is more playful but as the film progresses, he is actually the step-father and you also learn that his mother is having an affair.Doinel wants love but his step- father seems too weak (he suspects his wife is cheating) his mother too busy but he seems happiest when she does give him attention such as towelling him down after a bath.Doinel and his best friend Rene get into all sorts of scrapes and petty crime. Several times Doinel runs away from home and sleeps rough.He gets caught stealing a typewriter from his stepfather's workplace and comes into the attention of the police, social services and the judiciary. At the end he is sent to a young offender's institute that he also runs away from and onto a beach to what looks like an uncertain future.However Truffaut would re-visit Doinel over the course of his directing career.Watching this film it becomes apparent how much this influenced the British New Wave in the 1960s. So much of this film reminded me of Kes by Ken Loach with its naturalistic acting styles.Just look at the mischievous scene where the sports teacher takes the class for a walk around the streets of Paris and the kids disappear few at a time. Then there is the very naturalistic scene at the Punch & Judy show where the much younger kids are enjoying themselves.The city is a playground but when Doinel is living rough it is also oppressive and scary.Of course as time has gone on the shock value of the out of control adolescent has been lost with newer, more franker films.The French New Wave also had a different way of telling stories in the cinema that someone like me brought up on a diet of junk Hollywood blockbusters might not always appreciate. The film can be a little too wayward and loose.However the final freeze frame of a boy fulfilling his dream of seeing the sea but still alone and lost is regarded as a classic. Apparently this is the first time a film ends in a freeze frame.",

                "The memorable story of young, troubled Antoine is worth seeing for a good number of reasons, probably most of all for the thoughtful direction by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. It stands out from most other movies about troubled youths, both in the way that it portrays the main character and in making such good use of seemingly minor events in showing how they shape Antoine's life.As Antoine, Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud (in the role with which he would always be identified) strikes a nice balance in making his character come to life without making any of his actions seem forced or over-dramatic. Truffaut sets things up for him perfectly, by presenting a great variety of situations in his life that allow Antoine's character to come out naturally. Many of the settings are in themselves interesting and creative, despite being located in familiar types of places.The story is written carefully so as to allow the viewer to identify with and sympathize with Antoine, while still seeing his faults clearly. What is often the most affecting thing about it is the way that Truffaut shows how even the most commonplace kinds of events can have such an effect on a maturing person, if they are a source of disappointed expectations or misunderstood intentions. To make this kind of movie so effectively without relying on violent or shocking material is an admirable achievement, and it repays careful thought and attention while watching it.",

                "I first saw this film around three or four years ago for the first time. I had watched it late at night, and I was very sleepy after it ended. I was rather ambivalent towards it. To tell you the truth, I don't know whether I had even heard of it before I rented it. And I don't even remember if it was my first film by Francois Truffaut, either. I have seen two others, The Green Room, which I didn't like all that much, and Shoot the Piano Player, which I loved. My guess would be that I saw The Green Room first, then looked up what else Francois Truffaut had made, and which ones were considered his better films.Anyhow, by some route I rented The 400 Blows, and, as I said above, it left me unaffected. I went to bed afterwards without thinking much about it. It was only a couple of months later that I realized how good it was. The memories came flooding back one day when someone mentioned it to me. I have had similar experiences with La Dolce Vita and Casablanca, among others. As I thought more and more about it, I realized just how great it was.Still, I never went back to it until now. I am strange in that way. There are some movies, some of which aren't even that good, that I will watch over and over again, alone or with friends. There are other films which I know are great, but that I never feel I have time to revisit them (there are always more films to be watched). The 400 Blows is one of those films, unfortunately. I don't know why. I have even considered purchasing it several times. I never did. So when I saw it tonight, it was like seeing something brand new.I remembered only a few of the most memorable scenes: the carnival ride (followed by Antoine catching his mother with a strange man), the whole Balzac sequence, the psychologist's interview, and, of course, the famous final shot, the freeze-frame of Antoine Doinel looking into the camera. After this time, I will probably remember everything a lot better and a lot longer. The first time, when I was ambivalent, I had time to forget before I finally grabbed hold of those fading memories.Why is this film special? Because it is the perfect example of childhood caught on film. I don't think there is anyone who could watch it without thinking that it rings true. Every piece of film that deals with a similar subject falls behind this one. The only one that I can think of that comes anywhere near is Federico Fellini's _Amarcord_. Jean Vigo's _Zero for Conduct_ is also very interesting, and probably influenced this film a lot (I know Truffaut was familiar with it, but that may not have been until after this film came out). Antoine Doinel is such an endearing character. I hope that sometime soon I can procure and see his other filmic exploits. And I really need to see more Truffaut in general. I'm far behind with him. Well, The 400 Blows deserves a 10/10, no doubt. It is easily one of the best films ever made, and one of those films that any knowledgable person would include it in a list of films that are absolutely necessary for a student of film.",

                "As the seminal work of the French New Wave, the 1959 directorial debut of 27-year old Francois Truffaut has such a vaunted reputation that the final film is bound to disappoint. However, the pristine print that comes with the new Criterion Collection DVD really makes me realize what a brave and emotionally resonant film he made ostensibly about his own troubled adolescence. It's worth seeing twice - once for the film itself and a second time to listen to the newly recorded commentary by Truffaut's childhood friend Robert Lachenay (the true-life inspiration for Rene in the film). Speaking in French but subtitled in English, he provides insights into the story and context of the film that no film scholar or even production associate could possibly provide. As a point of comparison, listen to the by-the-numbers commentary by film scholar Brian Stonehill (recorded back in 1992), which is thoughtful and well researched but devoid of the human factor.The film's title comes from a French colloquialism that translates into \"raising hell\", an appropriate reference since the story focuses on a thirteen-year old hellion named Antoine, living in a poor section of Paris and neglected by parents downright arrogant in their dysfunctional nature. Antoine consequently lives a street urchin's life as he lies to people in authority - his parents, his teachers, and the police - since he admits rather sadly that the truth doesn't make any difference. Truffaut tracks Antoine's life through a series of dispiriting episodes that ultimately lead him to be sent away to a reformatory after he gets caught returning a stolen typewriter and his mother and stepfather tire of their responsibility over him. To Truffaut's immense credit, the film feels stark and naturalistic without resorting to dramatic manipulation, and he finds the ideal Antoine in Jean-Pierre Leaud, who brings out the confusion, angst and wandering attention of his character in realistic terms. He is especially impressive in an apparently improvised scene where he is interviewed by the school authorities about why his life has come to this. It is heartbreaking to see how bleak his life becomes, yet Leaud imbues the incorrigible, often intolerable side of Antoine with fervor.There are several interesting extras included with the 2006 DVD package starting with two separate interviews with Truffaut, the first a year after the film's release discussing he film's impact and the second five years later when we see the filmmaker in a more reflective mood about his cinematic influences. Leaud is featured in 16mm screen test footage where his naturally ebullient personality emerges and then after the 1959 Cannes Film Festival where puberty has apparently kicked in and then in 1965 as a comparatively reserved twenty-year old. The screen test of Richard Kanayan (who has a minor role as a schoolmate) is amusing for his Satchmo-inspired rendition of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" and his eerie resemblance to Fantasy Island's Tattoo, Herve Villechaize. Be forewarned that the film is relentlessly downbeat, but Truffaut's emotional investment and consummate abilities as a filmmaker, even at this stage of his career, make this essential viewing.",

He briefly runs away from home but then returns (or is returned...). After a while he ups the ante and turns to petty crime...Interesting drama. It also has its lighter side. There are many moments of comedy - the scene with the gym teacher taking the class for a walk was priceless! However, hardly the classic this is made out to be. Directed by Francois Truffaut, this is regarded as being the vanguard of the French New Wave movement. But it really isn't THAT good. It is hardly profound - the plot is a few weeks/months in the life of a early/mid-teens boy. There is no big realisation at the end, or plot closure.Even as a character-based film it is not fantastic. Yes, you feel some empathy for and engagement towards the boy but he is more villain than hero.

                "Les quatre-cents coups is the film that opens up the New Wave movement. I think many of the characteristics of the New Wave -as pointed out in class- can be inferred form the differences between the last film we saw in class, Carn\u00e9's Les enfants du paradis, and this work by Truffaut: real life situations, no sets, everyday people. I have found in Les quatre-cents coups a brand new, refreshing and overwhelming cinema. But Les quatre-cents coups is also a dense, complicated film. Its autobiographical character makes it an encyclopedia of personal feelings, opinions and nuances of an introspection by Truffaut.Technically, the main differences between Truffaut and the previous cinema is the use of camera movements and angles. Although Renoir had made a witty and fresh use of traveling and long takes, Truffaut masters this technique as anyone else does. The camera moves smoothly, it nearly swings or floats from angle to angle following an action, as if the spectator was a ghost amid real life. Truffaut enjoys playing around with the camera: extremely long takes as we have never seen in any of the previous films: some of them in the classroom, other in Antoine's friend house, or a magnificent take at the end of the film in which we see Antoine, then a panoramic view and then Antoine again, running towards the sea. He also shoots from impossible angles, like those at the beginning from below the Tour Eiffel, or the nearly zenithal take following the jogging students in the streets. Or he teases us with the fake black out, when Antoine goes down the stairs to throw away garbage. Or shows us inner feelings through close-ups: the scene in which Antoine lies to his father telling him he did not take his map.However, I think that the most important difference between previous films and this one is the treatment of action. Truffaut is an observer, a photographer of soul. He takes a fiendish delight in shooting casual, long scenes: the boy tearing away his notebook pages; the whole sequence of Antoine's arrival at his empty home is excellent: the three reflexes in his mother's mirror -in which she will look afterwards, or Antoine combing his hair, laying the table. Also the spinning ride, or the long traveling following the escape of Antoine. They are long, but not slow. They keep tension up, as if everyday acts and decisions could be heroic and transmit the greatest interest and attraction. It looks like a documentary on human life! Some comments could be made about Antoine Doinel, alter ego of Truffaut. He is a very complicated character. The most curious thing about him is that he behaves like an adult: he acts, walks and talks like a man -especially if we compare him to his teachers or his father! However, at some times I think Truffaut describes himself as being not too witty: remember the candle in the hole on the wall, or how his friend convinces him to steal the typewriter and then makes him give it back, or how he innocently copies a whole paragraph from Balzac. He wants to be an artist, but he is not -not yet. This lack of wit and fatality -he is caught but everyone around him cheats as he does- leads him to a rebellion that grows stronger and stronger. This explain why he is such a rebel and not his friend, or the other children in the class, who live in the same social group.The main topic in Les quatre-cents coups is the quest for freedom, but not in the way Renoir  looked at it, in fact is closer to L'Atalante by Vigo than to Renoir's La grande illusion, for example. Renoir is more concerned by social struggle and the liberty of the people. But Truffaut is more introspective, more intimate: indeed this film is the description of life attitude of an independent spirit through the autobiographical look of the author -this is cin\u00e9ma d'auteur. We can find many elements from Truffaut's life in the film: a difficult family situation, problems at school, the Army, etc. These elements will appear throughout the film. Antoine, alter ego of Truffaut lives in the school, in his house, in the streets and finally in the juvenile detention center. In each one of these places he will find adverse situations he will have to overcome.The school The school is the first oppressing environment for Antoine. At the very beginning he is caught, by chance, with a pin-up calendar. This fatality will be recalled in Antoine's life later or -when he is caught by the porter giving the typewriter back, having been his friend's idea to steal it. He is a rebel, and nothing will refrain him from being so. He is punished, and he misbehaves again, writing in the wall an inspired poem. The school is the only place in which Truffaut makes a little bit of criticism, in this case against the education system: the three teachers are either cruel (the French teacher) or stupid (the English and Physical Education teachers).The house The house situation might be similar to that lived by Truffaut in real life. Her mother, a beautiful, egocentric and unscrupulous woman -sometimes sad, and old looking- who hates him. At the end of the film we discover that she did not want that child. This hatred and the attitude of his father -a smiley and cheerful but weak man- will add to the necessity of Antoine to flee. Truffaut gives us a Freudian wink: when his teacher asks him why he missed school, Antoine will sharply answer: 'My mom died!'The streets In the streets Antoine will find freedom, challenge, adulthood but also perversion: he becomes a man in a 13-year old boy body, little by little. But he will also become a criminal; together with his friend they will climb up in the scale of crime. He first skips classes. He and his friend stroll around the city, innocently. Then they begin an adult, abnormally rebel behavior: they make cars stop in the middle of the street, for example. The spinning ride is one of the few symbolic images in the film -that is another difference with Vigo and Renoir filmmaking. The scene of Antoine trying without success to fight against centrifuge force in a mad spinning trip really shocked me: he fights against reality and he is suffering, but he also has fun in it. Afterwards, he leaves home. . He will learn about solitude and indeed not a single word is heard in a long sequence. I really enjoyed the long, silent scene of the milk robbery. Antoine runs outlaw like an animal, we can feel loneliness, cold, hunger, sleepiness. It is another of those long, slow but at the same time agile scenes about casual acts: drinking a bottle of milk. At the end, the streets will make him a criminal. From the moment he is caught on, he is not treated as a child anymore. He wants to be an adult, and a spell will sort of be cast on him: he will be treated as such. It is significant when he is caught by the porter. He is told not to take off the hat, which made him look like an adult. From then on, he is treated roughly as if he was a man, especially in the police station.The prison And finally he arrives at the prison, which I think is the climax of oppression -we must remember the comparisons to the Army Truffaut detests. It is maybe the simplest of the scenarios, he find himself facing what he hates with no other possibility. The ending is a sublime anticlimax. After being punished for eating the bread, Antoine goes on 'normal' life within the detention center: he visits the psychologist -an ultimate introspection by Truffaut-, receives his mother and talk to his new friends and plays soccer. And suddenly, when we least expect it, he flees. He runs, runs, runs, the longest run I have ever seen, and the most exciting. He reaches the sea: his dream, and a symbol for eternity and absolute in poetry. He splashes into the water, he stops and looks back; the first time he looks right into the camera. This has got undoubtedly a deep and very personal meaning that maybe only the author knows. It is a pessimistic or an optimistic ending? I think it is above all an out-of-this-world ending. If the simple presence of the sea, Antoine's object of liberty, is overwhelming for the spectator, how should the character feel? I really liked the final traveling: we follow Antoine's run over the sand, but the camera is facing the inland, we are waiting to see the sea as much as Antoine is waiting to wet his feet. I do not really think that he is deceived, although his look into the camera is ambiguous. I think he stares at the spectator because he has realized what the truth is: the character is now out of the film. And the truth for him, I think, is this: I can reach freedom whenever I want, but absolute freedom is impossible to achieve. He is staring at us, but he is also looking back with a grave look: he might have seen his pursuer in the distance.",

Antoine Doinel should have been proud of his mother after all!She wants him to have diplomas,who can blame her? 4.Compared to the innovations of \"Hiroshima mon amour\",which features a brand new form,and a new \"fragmented \" content,\"les 400 coups \" pales into significance.Truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior \"Jules and Jim\", helped by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau. 5.The interpretation is rather stiff;Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud ,arguably listenable when dubbed in English ,is still decent,but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation. 6.The topic=stolen childhood  had better days,before (Julien Duvivier's \"Poil de carotte\" ,Luis Bunuel's \"los olvidados\") and will have after (Maurice Pialat's \"l'enfance nue\",Kenneth Loach's \"Kes\") I do not want to demean Truffaut,his movie is not bad,but,frankly,French movie buffs,prefer \"Jules and Jim\" \"l'enfant sauvage\" (a film honest ,true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault)\"l'argent de poche\"(as academic as \"400 coups\" but much more funny)or his nice Hitchcock pastiche \"vivement dimanche\".",

                "Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's \"The 400 Blows\" is routinely listed as one of the greatest films in all of foreign cinema. At the time of its release it was hailed as an important film and subsequently proved to be immensely influential in the context of the French New Wave.The semi-autobiographical story concerns a Parisian adolescent (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) who attempts to escape problems at home and at school by delving into a life of petty crime. Unfortunately, he never receives more than a temporary respite from his predicament and frequently ends up deeper in trouble. The script is fairly loose and strives for realism above all else.Enforcing Truffaut's aim of realism is the group of actors that he assembled. L\u00e9aud indisputably carries the film, at once delivering an authentic performance while also showing a maturity beyond his years. While not quite as impressive, the supporting cast is nevertheless uniformly solid, perhaps none moreso than Guy Decomble as Antoine's antagonist at school.Truffaut's direction is exceedingly well-handled, not to mention impressive for a debut feature. The film also sports attractive cinematography and a lively score by Jean Constantin.Indeed, the film can scarcely be faulted for any flaw in its construction or execution. Instead, my tempered enthusiasm is the result of feeling a certain amount of detachment from the main character. Naturally, this sort of objection is largely personal so your mileage may vary.",

                "The Four Hundred Blows is the semi-autobiographical story of Antoine Doinel, a boy trapped in a life of contemtptuous authority who turns to outward rebellion.  Truffaut shows his mastery of the cinema in this, his freshman attempt.The film is perfectly cast with Dionel relaying neutral facial expressions for the majority of the film.  The boy, although not necessarily evoking sympathy from the audience, definitely evokes empathy.  He is a pathetic character forced into his position by his teacher and his almost uncaring mother.Throughout the film, Truffaut hints at the possibility of a happy life for the protagonist, but just as soon as the ideal is given to us, it is taken away.  The mood shifts in the film are fabulously orchestrated through contrasting scenes, music, and  even acting.  From the opening sequence through the final,  enigmatic still shot, the movie is a masterpiece of both French and world cinema.  It is a must see.",

                "This classic and unforgettable movie with amazing freshness catapulted Truffaut to international acclaim , dealing with a the trails and rebellious of 13-year-old Antoine Doinel . He is a rogue French schoolboy , starred by an adolescent Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud , being the first of Doinel series , following : L'amour \u00e0 vingt ans (original title) or El amor a los veinte a\u00f1os (1962) , a Short titled Antoine et Colette (1962) , Stolen kisses or Baisers vol\u00e9s (original title) (1968) , Bed and Board or Domicile conjugal (1970) , Love on the run or L'amour en fuite (1979) . The downtroddem , neglected and rebel teen Doinel delves into a life of petty crime . Antoine (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) is often in trouble at school , especially with his French teacher 'Petite Feuille', (Guy Decomble) and doesn't get along with his parents (Claire Maurier , Albert Remi) , particularly his mum . While his friend Ren\u00e9 suggests that they play truant . Both of whom often skip school to go to a funfair attraction park or to carry out tiny theft . Antoine and Rene are suspended from school , they go gallivanting around the town. Unless something drastic changes in Antoine's life, he is destined down a path that will lead to nothing good, which is more problematic as he gets older. Instead of going to school, Antoine along with his friend Ren\u00e9 go to the cinema, play pinball, and visit a huge amusement rotor , a real funfair attraction . The following day Antoine tells his teacher that his absence was due to his mother's death; unfortunately his parents show up at school .Then he briefly runs away from home but then goes back . Things go wrong when Antoine to get money steals a typewriter from his father's office , being trapped by a janitor. It is quasi-autobiographical account of 13-year-old Antoine's bleak odyssey through family life , reform school whose precarious permanence is questioned and getaway . From the Vanguard of New Film-Makers Comes an Extraordinary Motion Picture . The Best Directed Picture Cannes International Film Festival 1959 . Angel faces hell-bent for violence.Still one of the cinema's most sensitive , perceptive forays into infancy , it is intensely stirring but never mawkish , as Truffaut reveals an actual complicity with the rebellious teenager , being Fran\u00e7ois 's first major motion picture. Shot on location in Paris in almost-documentary style and with a casually vivid eye . An increasingly compromised and attractive work in which Truffat demonstrates his narrative skills , being infinitely better than other self-indulgent films towards the end of his career . Fun for spotting the guest appearance of such Nouvelle Vague French luminaries such as Jacques Demy , Jeanne Moreau , Jean Claude Brialy , Jean Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut himself .Thought-provoking and engaging finale when a juvenile-court judge sends him to an observation centre in the countryside, from where he runs away, and doesn't stop until he reaches the sea , there takes place the frozen image of the boy face ; is it point of no return or freedom ? .Truffaut was seeking a young actor able to play Antoine Doinel, a troubled adolescent, in his first feature film \"The 400 blows\". Jean-Pierre was tested among a hundred other candidates and proved so amazingly spontaneous and so gifted for improvisation that not only was he hired but he would go on to play the role in four subsequent Truffaut semi-autobiographies concluding with \"Love on the run\" (1978), a unique experience indeed. Well starred by the boy Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud with a long career along with Truffaut , Leaud is not everybody's cup of tea for sure, but will remain an important name in film history. Thanks to Truffaut he was introduced to the other stars of the French New Wave, mainly Jean-Luc Godard for whom he would appear in eight films and one TV film, and gradually became their icon. As an actor he can be adored or hated for exactly the same reasons: he is one of those rare players that directors let improvise his dialogue, which gets on certain viewers' nerves while it fascinates others . The same is true for his very personal staccato diction and elocution and his many mannerisms, the most obvious one being his way to run his hand through his long hair. This is a semi-biography of Truffaut himself , in fact the French director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut began to assiduously go to the movies at age seven similar to Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud and he was even a great reader but not a good pupil . He left school at 14 and started working. Furthermore , the movie is dedicated to Andre Bazin , aged 15, as he founded a film club and met Andr\u00e9 Bazin , a French critic, who became his protector. Bazin helped the delinquent Truffaut and also when he was put in jail because he deserted the army .It displays an atmospheric musical score by Antoine Duhamel , Truffaut's usual musician . As well as an evocative , adequate cinematography in black and while and documentary style by prestigious cameraman Henry Decae . The motion picture was competently directed by Truffaut , being one of the greatest and most influential of his films . His main themes were passion, women , childhood and faithfulness . His films gets several references to the American cinema, as Truffaut was a fervent moviegoer, such as : Johnny Guitar, Bogart, and his idolized Hitchcock . In fact , he was a big Alfred Hitchcock fan and defined him as his master . In 1953 Truffaut published his first movie critiques in \"Les Cahiers du Cinema.\" In this magazine Truffaut, and some of his friends as passionate as he was, became defenders of what they call the \"author policy\". In 1954, as a test, Truffaut directed his first short film. Two years afterwords he assisted Roberto Rossellini with some later abandoned projects . The year 1957 was an important one for him: he married Madeleine Morgenstern, the daughter of an important film distributor, and founded his own production company, Les Films du Carrosse; named after Jean Renoir's Le carrosse d'or (1952). He also directed Les mistons or the brats (1957), considered the real first step of his cinematographic work. His other big year was 1959: the huge success of his first full-length film, 400 blows (1959), was the beginning of the New Wave, a new way of making movies in France. This was also the year his first daughter, Laura Truffaut, was born. From 1959 until his death, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's life and films are mixed up. Let's only note he had two other daughters Eva Truffaut (b. 1961) and Josephine (b. 1982, with French actress Fanny Ardant). He also directed thrillers and intrigue movies such as \u00a8Shoot the piano player\u00a8 is one of the best of his suspense movies along with \u00a8Farenheit 451\u00a8, \u00a8Mississippi mermaid\u00a8 , and \u00a8The Bride Wore Black\u00a8.

                "Spoilers herein.With this film began an experiment that was to ultimately fail after dozens of notable films. It was much like the experiment in art nouveau in architecture seventy years earlier. I suppose that every art has cycles which begin with a collapse of the passion in artifice and a resulting call to the spontaneously natural.In this case, we have a camera acting as a selfaware human voyeur. There is no story: we simply enter and leave one life at arbitrary points. There is no drama, instead the `natural' drama of life. There are in fact none of the theatrics traditionally used to exaggerate so that things convey as real. The philosophy here is that REAL is real.Seeing this film again after my first viewing 35 years ago shocks me at the naivete of both Truffaut and myself then. I still celebrate nature, but I no longer believe it can be found in a zoo, where someone like Truffault can walk me through, pointing out what he thinks is interesting.Film, I believe, is something new still. Something that is beginning to change the way we conceptualize the most basic elements of life. Our bodies have stopped evolving, and that evolution has shifted to the level of tropes -- some in visual grammar -- that act selfishly to embed and promote themselves. Part of their defense is to periodically prompt us to believe that film is a mere window to reality. But that notion always collapses.This film is important because one can trace that collapse of induced naivete from its beginning here to an end. A complete cycle, whose final end I might place in Malick's ` Thin Red Line.' (`Moulin Rouge' likely begins a cycle on the other side.)",

                "Francois Truffaut's first feature, and like many first features it's semi-autobiographical. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. As Joyce advised, \"Wipe your glosses with what you know.\" There are only two cautions to be observed. One is that your first story, about yourself, doesn't turn you into a moral paragon. The second is that, having gotten that initial material out of your system, you have the industry and talent to go on to other things -- not necessarily less personal, but less heavily invested. Truffaut managed to rise well above his beginnings.Jean-Pierre Leaud is the boy of about twelve who lives in a shabby and cramped apartment in Paris with a mother who, though she sometimes tries her best to act otherwise, doesn't really want him and never has. Leaud's father doesn't mind the kid, but things are tough. Both parents work. The mother is being unfaithful and the father is distant.So Leaud begins to get into trouble at school. (And what a run-down, working-class school it is.) He writes graffiti, gets caught, gets punished, but seems to learn nothing from it, nor from forging a note excusing his absence by claiming that his mother has died. He winds up running away from home, stealing a typewriter, getting caught, and sent to an \"observation camp\" where he's subject to tough love and interviews by a social worker. He runs away from the camp too and the last scene is of Leaud chugging along a wide strand, splashing through the tiny waves of icy sea water.Truffaut doesn't give Leaud easy excuses. He's gone through tribulations, certainly, but so have many of the other kids in his class. And at least Leaud wasn't sexually abused as a child -- the kiss of death in movies these days. But his story isn't one of a born delinquent either. He takes no pleasure in destroying things or in hurting or disappointing others. He exploits nobody.And the parents themselves aren't evil or weak. Their foibles are recognizably human. His parents only rarely indulge him but they never beat him. The boy may live in a bare apartment with cracked walls and not enough furniture or heat, but so do his mother and father, so they're subject to the same physical stressors.In fact, there's nobody in the whole movie who is entirely evil or entirely good, despite the fact that the film is in black and white.There is a vein of comedy in it too. Their language teacher is trying to get them to pronounce English correctly. \"Where is the girl?\", he asks one student in clear and precise tones. \"At the bitch,\" replies the student, and the teacher explodes in a volcano of insults in French -- and he stutters! Overall, what you're most likely to get out of this film is a sense of Truffaut's abiding pity for the human condition. Take the Punch and Judy show that we see a couple of dozen young kids watching. The camera pans slowly across their faces, and we see them laughing and yelling -- and we see their misshapen heads, their diminutive chins, their crossed eyes, and those ears that kids of that age tend to have, like African elephants sticking out from their skulls, all ready to flap with excitement. You have to love kids to love that kind of ugliness.The style is grainy and documentary with only occasional touches of art that are noticeable enough to call attention to themselves. Two kids sit on a bench in a wintry garden and talk about their hated parents while the camera deliberately lifts itself to a syrupy statue above them in which a loving mother is kissing a cherub.And that last shot -- a freeze frame of Leaud on the beach at the end of his tether, unable to go forward into the sea, unable to retreat to the camp he's just escaped from. The image is still and Leaud is captured staring into the camera lens, waiting, as it were, for the audience to judge him. We, the jury.Truffaut was one of the New Wave of French directors, most of them formerly critics for a French magazine. (They gave us the term \"film noir.\") Jean-Luc Goddard was another. But I think Truffaut leaves Goddard in the dust. Goddard is far more fashionable because of his on-screen pyrotechnics. He up-ended the grammar of film, as if to say, \"Look at me, Ma!\" What he did to editing alone was what Sinead O'Connor did to the Pope's photo. And he was political in the right way for the time. But he lacks Truffaut's essential humanity or, let's be honest, his humility. Maybe it's just me but compassion seems a more evolved emotion than aggression. I wonder if Truffaut ever read Rousseau.",

                "Truffaut has worked wonders here, creating a masterful tale of a boy confused, troubled, and unloved. Antoine Doinel (played superbly by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud in the lead role) has strict, unfaithful parents, and a harsh, oppressive teacher, and falls into delinquency because of his unhappiness. He lies, steals, skips school and runs away from home, and soon ends up in a juvenile delinquency centre.Truffaut's inspiration for this film came from his own depressed childhood, so he bases Antoine on himself, including in terms of appearance. Being a 'New Wave' (a cinematographic movement of the sixties, involving directors who believed Hollywood films were too lavish and unreal) director, Truffaut always used a real location for the film, including breathtaking shots of Truffaut's native Paris. He also made a cameo in the film in the style of Hitchcock.Delinquance is the key theme here. Antoine, who is a character who believes in liberty and freedom, and the way he is always locked up is repressive for him, and this provokes a constant need for him to be out.Trying to make a realistic and moving film was Truffaut's aim, which, by watching this film, I realised that he had done amazingly well. Also, by combining humour and drama too, we have the defining French film of the 20th century. A black and white film that is full of colour. Bien sur, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.",

                "It's of course ridicules to call this movie a bad one but as far as so called new wave French movies go, this isn't the best example of it, in my opinion.Can't really see how people can call this one of the most powerful and emotional drama's ever made, unless you perhaps had a tough youth yourself and can identify yourself with its young main character. Perhaps it's also due to the fact that it is of course being placed in a totally different time period, at also a different country and culture but personally I couldn't really place myself in his shoes because throughout the movie he's doing some things that I can't see myself ever doing or saying to someone.But this is perhaps also one of the powers of the movie, at the same time. It's not showing things and people as just black and white, good or bad but it more shows that nobody is truly a good or a bad person. Sometimes it are certain circumstances that force us to do things in order to 'survive' in this world. Whether or not you like it, you sometimes have to do things you know you're later going to regret.In that regard this is a quite good random slice of life, or a coming of age movie. You could take the movie both these ways really, since it for a change is a movie that entirely focuses on its young main character and tells the entire story from his perspective. It's an original but also risky approach to the genre, that in this case did work out, also really thanks to Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, who plays the young boy.So it all in all really remains a well put together movie, by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, that just didn't really ever got to me at a more emotional level. Extra praise should be send Truffaut's way though, since this movie actually was his first full length movie and he made at a quite a young age as well. Definitely not a bad first movie by him, though thankfully still he and his movies grew better over the years.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

It delves into child psychology and remains engaging for most of the time. It is highly structured in its narration with a nice flow maintained aside a beautiful portrayal of Paris streets it captures.But overall it has its disappointments which gives reservations to place it in the position of \"The Bicycle Thieves.\" First of all the film ends inconclusive. It raises some issues on childhood problems concerning the schools and families, which isn't resolved. The problems raised feel single dimensional and on its way fails to make a compelling watch though technically it feels flawless along few endearing performances to admire.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",

                "One of the defining films of its director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as well as the French New Wave movement. The latter was a loose term joining together a group of mid-century French film makers that took upon as their goal to talk about current subjects, to experiment with the film medium and to ground it in reality through real locations and modern subject matters.And keeping that in mind, it's easy to see why this film become such a cornerstone for them. It tells about a young Parisian school boy Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud), who struggles in every area of his life. His parents heap both scorn and misunderstandings upon him, his school work barely passes muster, and he spends most of his days partaking in minor crimes and misdemeanours. The film doesn't really have a traditional story arc. Doinel doesn't learn that much, his circumstances don't really change. Rather the whole film has the atmosphere of the inevitable in it as Doinel's life slowly spirals deeper and deeper into ruin, culminating in the last haunting shot of him staring directly into the camera on a deserted beach, silently crying for rescue.And yes, the film has a rather gruff feel. It seems like they simply set up the camera, shot the scene and excited the room. Which of course is the ideal of New Wave, but takes some getting used to from a viewer more familiar with mainstream film media.Still, it's a beautiful film in its own way. Personally I appreciate the ideal it represents more than I appreciate it as a stand-alone film, but I'm still glad I saw it.",

                "In viewing Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's The 400 Blows for perhaps the fifth time, I finally began to realize its true greatness. Inspired by the director's childhood, The 400 Blows (Truffaut's first film) is primarily about a young boy growing up with his mother and stepfather in Paris and apparently heading into a life of crime. Most adults see the boy as a troublemaker, but in the film, he is meant to be the protagonist.Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) is the boy's name. He is resourceful, quiet, and does what he can to get by. At home, he has a struggling relationship with his parents, especially his mother. She is a woman of curious interests, always distracted by her incommodious son and a secret affair with a man from her job. Antoine's stepfather appears nice enough while treating his son as an equal in a good manner, although he is not really attached to him. However, both parents share common traits: they are away from home quite a bit and do not pay close enough attention to their son. Sadly enough, they only judge him by his behavior and by reports they get from other people.At school, Antoine's teacher classifies him as a menacing troublemaker. Not that it is entirely Antoine's fault, he just has terrible luck. In the opening scene of the film, we see a poster with a half-naked woman on the front being passed around quietly by the students. The teacher is sitting at his desk with his head down, grading papers, until the poster comes to Antoine and he finds it. He sends Antoine to the corner of the room, where he writes a note of resentment on the wall. As punishment for that, he is to diagram the exact words that he wrote. At home that night, Antoine's homework is interrupted. Because he did not complete it, his good friend Ren\u00e9 convinces him to skip school the next day, although Antoine is reluctant at first. They walk around France and notice Antoine's mother kissing a man that is not her husband. She and her son make eye contact, but Ren\u00e9 assures his friend that everything will be alright. The next morning, as the boys return to school, Antoine lies to his teacher and says the reason he missed school was that his mother died. Everything is alright until his mother, furious, arrives at school and her son is immediately identified as a liar.And yet, we see Antoine alone at home in some private, subtle, and hopeful moments. One of them being, his love for Balzac. He adores him, and we see him reading his biography and lighting a candle in a shrine in his honor at home. One day, at school, the students are proposed to write an essay on an important event in their life, and Antoine chooses the topic of his grandfather's death, in which he incorporates a phrase from his Balzac book. Alas, the teacher identifies this as plagiarism, and sends Antoine out of the classroom, along with Ren\u00e9. The two boys stay at Ren\u00e9's house for quite some time, living up to the expectations of a life of crime, until they steal a typewriter leaving Antoine caught trying to return it. He is later sent to a juvenile delinquent detention home.The 400 Blows is not meant to be a tragedy. Rather, it is a character study following Antoine Doinel's life and decisions he makes as a direct result of the many things going on in it. Even The 400 Blows captures a few moments of happiness joy. One of these is a priceless sequence in which a gym teacher is leading Antoine's class for a jog through Paris, not realizing that the boys are peeling off and running away two by two. There is another scene after Antoine's shrine for Balzac catches on fire and his parents are stressing and yelling at him. His mother suggests an outing to a movie theater, where they end up going. After the film, we see the trio in the car, laughing and reflecting on what they had seen. We see this as a moment of hope for Antoine and his family, for this being the only time they are all happy together.There are many poignant moments however, emerging late in the film after Antoine is caught for stealing the typewriter. His father is fed up with his behavior and escorts him to a police station where he is sent to a jail cell and later in a police wagon full of prostitutes and thieves, with his face peering through the bars, full of tears. His parents discuss with the authorities that they cannot not take him back because they believe he will only run away again. So, in turn, their son is taken to the juvenile delinquent school. These sequences express a reality of Antoine's life, in tune with the outcome of himself. He remains quiet and reserved towards the end of the film, as if he has nothing to say. The story of Antoine Doinel and his many experiences allow a life to be filled with curiosity and exploration. Every second of the ninety-nine minutes of the film is not wasted. Truffaut allows every minute to be overflowing with creativity while still maintaining the central story of the protagonist. It is not a film that can be taken lightly as a family movie to be watched every Saturday night. It is a film to be given plenty of thought, carefully examined, and given a conclusion. The genius of the film does not rely on that, moreover, it relies on how much is put into the film. Down to the smallest detail, the film is able to maneuver and progress. The story contains elements of sadness, regret, family, warmth, happiness, humor, values, and choices. Just like life itself.",

                "'The 400 blows' immediately introduces its hero in a breathless credit sequence: I mean the Eiffel Tower, glimpsed from different angles as the camera drives through the streets of Paris, emerging from behind buildings, through trees, opening onto avenues.  It is a magnet - wherever you go you move towards it - and a totem.  This sequence is transposed later, when Antoine goes to the funfair, and rides on one of those moving cylinders, like a zoetrope.  The comparison is deliberate - Truffaut is situating his film in film history, declaring his intention to start again, to get back to first principles, to a time when moving pictures was a medium of possibility, before it was bogged down by genre and the studio system.  this zoetrope has a transformative power - it takes a character from neo-realism and abstracts him, turning him into a figure in a Grand Guignol, crawling in eternal circles.  But, from his point of view, it completely transforms the outside world, from a thing of oppressive solidity content to stare in powerful distance, to a formless, unstable mass.  This sequence crystallises the power of Truffaut's film, its freedom and its concern with entrapment.  It charts the decline into imprisonment of its main character with a style of buoyant liberation.  So while Antoine is trapped in this barrel, he is also offered a new way of looking beyond those merely content to look on from the outside.'The 400 Blows' is the first masterpiece of the nouvelle vague, that iconoclastic movement that briefly saved cinema from stagnation as an art-form, just as it declared that it was an art-form (hmm, a connection?). It's a cliche now that Truffaut was the least innovative of the New Wavers, and yet it's still surprising that a film built so classically (moving from Paris to the countryside; balancing the opening school scene, with its barred doors, with the closing borstal scene etc.) still achieves that tingling spontaneity so rare in the cinema (e.g. Jean-Pierre Leaud as an actor laughing with the crew as Albert Remy breaks an egg).  The first viewing of '400' is such a rush you'd be forgiven for thinking that it, like 'A Bout de souffle', was made up on the spot, and it is only on subsequent viewings that you marvel at Truffaut's formal control, the rhythm of his camera movements and editing, the consideration of his compositions. \nThat image of spinning round a fixed pole is the one that haunts me.  Just as the decline of Michel Poiccard in the Truffaut-scripted 'A Bout de souffle' is figured as a car running out of steam, so Antoine is forever running in circles, brought back to a fixed point, having gotten nowhere. To move is to live - that is why the final freeze-frame is so frightening: Antoine has usurped the Eiffel Tower, has become the centre of the spinning top - he dominates the closing frame, just as the opening ones were empty (of humans).  But at what cost? - has he simply wound down into inertia?: the subsequent Doinel films would suggest so.  (that closing beach scene, in which Antoine seems to be running against moving, phosphorescent sand, also alludes to another great work about a young artist and his city, Joyce's 'Ulysses' and its chapter 'Proteus')Although the film rarely shoots directly from his point of view, the style is an exuberant expression of Antoine's sensibility.  Antoine is ambisexual, still seeking his identity, just before seeking sexuality - early on he sits at his mother's dressing table, his face splintered by the triptych mirrors; later he steals supplies from the ladies' toilet.  This embodying of subjectivity in objective style is what saves the closing third from de Sica-like sentimentality and manipulation: we are rarely outside Antoine's head, people are wonderful or horrible as he experiences them.  Only twice is his sensibility intruded on - when he is caught bringing back the typewriter, the captor creeping his point of view; and the interview with the faceless psychologist at the borstal, filmed as if behind a double-sided mirror, the feral animal penned at last.'The 400 blows' is revered as a moving, melancholy picture of misdirected adolescence.  It is sometimes forgotten that most of the film is pure comedy, delighting in gags, digressions, bits of business.  For much of the running time, you envy Antoine - what joy it must be to be young and in Paris, swashbuckling in the schoolyard, truanting in the city, smoking cigars: his family situation is no worse that most, at least he has friends, a roof over his head, and can read Balzac. Antoine is a bit of a clown: all clowns eventually settle down, make the right choices at crucial moments in their lives.  Antoine somehow misses those rarely visible choices and finds himself locked up, descending the various levels of institutional hell.  His often amiable and/or witty parents are no more evil than he is a saint, although an educational system that asks kids to simply copy down 'great' poems (a Sisyphean task in one ink-blotted case) is clearly wrong.  Georges Delerue's score - romantic, exuberant, tragic, bittersweet - ranks with the three greats ('Vertigo', 'Taxi Driver', 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg').",

                "Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) is a fourteen years old boy rejected by his mother and his stepfather, who gave him his name. This lack of affection in his home makes him a rebel, bad student, liar, reckless and stealing objects and money at home. This movie was the first one directed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffault and is a landmark of the Nouvelle Vague, a French style of making films initiated by Truffault and Godard. This movement has produced low budget, but high quality movies, using a small crew, hand camera and free screenplay, with lots of creation and improvisation. The character Antoine is the alter-ego of Truffault. His crimes, watched in the Twentieth-First Century, are minors, but in 1959 were much serious. It is a very good movie, recommended for those who indeed loves cinema. My vote is nine.",

                "Antonie Doinel is a typical young boy living in Paris. His mother and father are rather distant and pay him little attention when he is around the house. Fed up with school he decides to just skive off and spend the day hanging around, playing with his friends in the local theme park. It is while he is doing this that he spies his mother kissing someone other than his father. This marks the start of a chain of events that see him getting into more trouble both at home and at school.Although I have written a rough plot summary, I must note that I think this film is more about Antonie than it is any more traditional narrative. The film follows Antonie through the troubles he has in his young life, always painting him as a realistic character \u0096 never too simplistic so as to be totally likable (what child is!?) but not a brat like some kids are in American movies. This is crucial to the film because it is so observational that it could almost be a documentary due to its style. This is down to the natural direction from Truffaut, a skill that is only helped by his excellent use of the locations, in particular the streets of Paris. Although his story is extreme in its fate, it is still engaging and touching to see Antonie's story and be involved in his young struggles \u0096 whether it be school, distant parents or a lack of direction in life. The complex feelings around this time are well delivered, right down to the ambiguous ending where we are not told how Antonie actually feels.The playing from Leaud is excellent and I only wish that more child actors would be like him; natural, confident, vulnerable and convincing in front of the camera. He is well supported by people like Remy, Maurier, Decomble and Flamant but the film is his and I was very impressed by his performance. Of course, aside from him the other star is Truffaut himself and (as well as a cameo) his direction is great, natural, intimate and painting a convincing world for this story to occur within.Overall this is a small little film that succeeds in making the life of Antonie be very interesting and engaging. The plot may require the story to go beyond the day-to-day experiences of most of us did at that age but it is still emotionally involving thanks to a great combination of a superb and natural performance from Leaud, the direction of Truffaut and the great use of locations throughout.",

                "I've seen this film about five times over the last twenty-five years.  As narrative, this film is quite boring.  I can never become involved with or care much for its characters.  It is a depressing picture of a twelve-year-old boy who is trapped by parents and teachers, by public school, and by reform school.  An American film about this subject in 1959--the year of this film--would either have tried to squeeze a tear from the audience's eye or would have tried to arouse the audience to action, and would have been presented to the audience as a sensational expose of juvenile delinquency.  This film just presents its story in a straightforward, objective, slice-of-life manner.  I think that's why it's so depressing.Since I know Truffaut is a fan of Hitchcock, I thought some of the narrative line might have grown out of an episode Hitchcock often related--how his father had him locked up in jail overnight as a youth to teach him a lesson.I feel this film is worth more as an historical item than as entertainment. For this reason, it should be taught in film courses and will have a certain impact on young, first-time viewers.  Historically, it's important (1) as a film that helped form the French New Wave; (2) because Truffaut went on to become an important film director and this film is autobiographical; (3) as the first of the Antoine Doinel series, Doinel being a cinematic semi-autobiographical figure for Truffaut.  Actually, I have been bored to varying degrees by all the Doinel films and find Jean-Pierre Leaud, who plays Doniel in \"The 400 Blows\" as well as the other films in the series, to be a nincompoop.The technique in this film is very like the Italian neo-realist films, especially a film like \"Open City.\"  It's shot in low-contrast black and white, it's shot in actual locations around Paris; it presents a slice of life.Despite all I've written above, I've seen many Truffaut films that I've liked very much (Shoot the Piano Player, Jules and Jim, The Soft Skin, The Bride Wore Black, Mississippi Mermaid (complete version), The Woman Next Door, among others) but not the Antoine Doniel films.",

        "synopsis": "Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) is an orphan who dropped out of school after his 4th grade. Now he is a contented businessman running a cable TV service in Goa. He is married to Nandini (Shriya Saran), and have Anju, his adopted daughter (Ishita Dutta), a class twelve student, and Anu (Mrunal Jadhav), a class six student. His only interest is watching films. He has gained fame in his area for helping people out with the help of methods he learns from films.\nDuring a nature camp which Anju attends, a hidden cell phone camera records Anju removing her clothes and showering in the bathroom. The culprit, Sameer \"Sam\" Deshmukh (Rishabh Chaddha), is the son of Inspector General of Goa Police, Meera Deshmukh (Tabu). Sam comes to blackmail Anju for sexual favors. Nandini pleads with Sam to leave their family alone, but Sam refuses to delete the video clip unless his sexual demand is fulfilled. In an attempt to break the offending cell phone, Anju takes a swing at Sam with a lead pipe, but she strikes him in the head instead, killing him immediately. They bury his body in a compost pit in the backyard, which is witnessed by Anu. In the morning, when Vijay returns from work, Nandini tells Vijay about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the police. He removes the broken cell phone and disposes of Sam's car, which is seen by the corrupt Sub-Inspector Laxmikant Gaitonde (Kamlesh Sawant), who has a grudge against Vijay. The next day, Vijay takes his family out on a trip to Panjim, where they visit an Ashram, watch a movie, and eat at a restaurant. Meera, realizing that her son has gone missing, starts an investigation.\nAfter a preliminary investigation, Meera calls Vijay and family for questioning. Having predicted that the police would come calling eventually, Vijay coaches his family on how to face the interrogations without raising suspicion. When questioned individually, the family sticks to their individual stories and the police are unable to find a crack in their alibis. Vijay produces bus tickets, movie tickets, lodging and restaurant bills as proof for the family's visit to Panaji. Meera questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Vijay's alibi. Meera realizes that on the day of the incident, Vijay had taken the tickets and the bill, made acquaintance with the owners and had gone for the trip with his family the next day, thus proving his alibi and making the owners unwittingly tell the lie.\nMeera has the Salgaonkar family arrested, and Gaitonde uses brute force to beat the truth out of them though Vijay, Nandini and Anju resist. Meanwhile, Meera finds out about Sam and his video of Anju from Sam's friend, Alex. Eventually, Anu gives in and reveals that she has seen a body being buried in the compost pit. After digging the compost pit, the authorities find the carcass of a dog. Vijay reports to the media that Gaitonde physically abused both his daughters, causing an angry Gaitonde to attempt an attack on Vijay, but Vijay's in-laws retaliate, and a mob rises up to beat up Gaitonde. The Sub-inspector is suspended, Meera resigns from her post, and the entire investigating team of the Police Station is transferred out, with the case now requiring authorization from the court. When Nandini asks Vijay about what he did to the body, he refuses to tell her, saying that the information is safe with him. Meera and her husband Mahesh (Rajat Kapoor) meet Vijay at a seaside to ask forgiveness for their rude and violent behavior and to get a confirmation whether their son is alive or not. They also reveal that they would be leaving for London to live with their relative. Finally, Vijay cryptically confesses to killing Sam . Vijay also asks for forgiveness, and explains to them that he would go to any lengths to protect his family. Vijay signs a register at the newly constructed local police station. The new police inspector threatens Vijay that he shall find the body. As Vijay leaves with smile, a flashback reveals that he has buried Sam's body under the floor of the new police station, while it was under construction.",

                "DRISHYAM REVIEW- Hell yeah, just watched the Masterpiece, gem of thriller. Wow is the only word is in mouth now for this movie. Heard a remake of national award Malayalam movie is coming in bollywood and i was just waiting like anything for this movie. Trailer didn't offered much but it was promising. Then critics reviews came which took my expectations to sky level. And finally after watching it i must say movie worths it. A rare thriller which was made to look realistic only not as filmy masala content. First half takes time to set platform, sets movie plot then 2nd half blows you away with its masterclass planning and scenes. A simple plot, a common man who is 4th std failed not much educated tries to hide his family's crime from so called educated police officers. But the content and screenplay is so realistic that it makes this simple story a masterpiece. Even a Long runtime of 2 hrs 40 mins looks too tight and glues us to Our seat. Writer has done an extraordinary job, people will not forget this story in lifetime. Kudos to him and screenplay maker . Music wasn't much needed for movie,still 1 song after interval is situational which plays important role to make scene much tight. Entire star cast acted like real incident and really made me feel that its all happening in real in front of me. Ajay devgn the man who is the soul of this movie. His acting is just out of the world. Those intense eyes, innocent expressions, scary scenes and some emotional scenes as if this movie made for his acting only. Surely best performance of the year till date and i don't think someone will give better performance than him in this year at least, he deserves an award for this movie. Tabbu role is exactly half to Ajay according to runtime of movie. She did whatever expected from her role. Other star cast did fab job, each and every actor gave his best for their roles. Director Nishikant Kamat proves his skills and talent metal again here. He never left movie's grip till the end. Even the last ending scene of the movie was watchable and gives goosebumps. Hats off to him. He already had remake in hand which made direction much easier so there was no chance to make movie a crap. Overall a must watch for all. Only kids wont understand it, but other audience like classes, masses, youngsters and even seniors will love it. Go for this one, take 3 hrs from your life and enjoy the rare and the best thriller ever made in bollywood. Don't miss, you cant afford to miss this masterpiece. Here we have got the best movie of 2015. Last line, 'Its like,'Shawshank Redemption in bollywood. 9/10 * stars by me :)",

                "What are the necessary requirements for making a good movie? I guess strong acting, realistic judgments made by characters, complementary music and tight pacing are essential elements in achieving this. In all these departments, Drishyam stands head and shoulders over every other Bollywood movie that has come out in this year. Even though it is a remake of a Malyalam movie, there is no loss of quality and it delivered emphatically.The essence of the movie is that due to some unexpected turn of events, a normal middle-class family gets itself involved in the missing case of the son of Senior Police Officers. As they never intended to do anything wrong, they decide to forge a story to dupe the police and save themselves.Ajay Devgan and Tabu are the two established actors in this movie, and both of them prove their mettle. It is a welcome change for Ajay Devgan as he has made one bad movie after another despite possessing great acting talent. He plays Vijay who runs a cable TV network and leads a modest life that revolves around his family. Tabu, on the other hand plays the IG officer who is the mother of her missing son. She once again proved that she is the finest actress in Bollywood with a menacing, layered performance that will leave people spellbound.Drishyam is a suspense movie and the director does well to include several trademark techniques that are used in such movies. The slow- zoom, slick editing and the tense background score all add another dimension to the well-written thriller. The movie explores several elements of Indian life such as the rampant corruption of police officers, unyielding devotion to family, and the longing for revenge. Drishyam is a well-made movie that deserves wide recognition for its achievement in making something that everyone can relate with. All the actions that the characters made were justifiable and any other person in that situation would have done the same. I have not revealed much about the movie in this review because you have to see it to understand the power of this movie.",

Must be some blind bhakt who aint fond of this movie or my review or must be some fan boy who must hav got pissed off thru my imdb reviews.Unfortunately, there r countless blind bhakts n countless fan boys in my beautiful India.I saw this movie with my entire family in a theatre n that too, first day, first show.This aint ur regular Bollywood trash as there aint no songs, no dance, no unnecessary shirtless stuff, no gravity defying badly choreographed action, no jingoism n no melodrama.This one is a taut thriller with a superb performance by Ajay Devgn. He lost all his muscles n got into the skin of the character.His plain shirt, trouser n slippers act is convincing as a common person. Devgn is terrific n he nailed the character.The other guy who played Gaitonde is superb too.Audiences were cheering when he gets a beating. Such was the impact of his devilish act.It reminded me of a real life incident i read about.I read that many fellas in real life were very angry due to John Carradine's character shooting Jesse James (1939 version) at the movie's end. They say a young boy kicked John Carradine on his shoe during the premiere.Coming back to this film, it is full of tension n suspense throughout n the twist in the end makes it a top notch cerebral film.The saddest scene is the one where the character of Tabu n her onscreen husband anticipates their son's arrival whenever the door bell rings.Check out Suspect X (2008), Perfect Number (2012) n The Devotion of Suspect X (2017).All are based on the 2005 novel The Devotion of Suspect X (2005) by Keigo Higashino.",

Drishyam is a remake of the Malayalam movie by the same title.\u00a0The movie is nestled in a Goan village, the kind where everyone knows one- another. The protagonist is a middle-class Goan\u00a0Vijay Salgaonkar( Ajay Devgn) for whom his family's well being is paramount.Ajay plays the role of a 5th class school-dropout who runs a local cable-service provider shop. He is a big movie-buff and spends most of his time at work looking at the motion pictures. \u00a0Vijay has a cozy life with his wife Nandini(Shriya Saran) , elder daughter( Ishita Dutta, 'Poonam\u00a0 from Ek Ghar Banaunga'\u00a0 & Tanushree Dutta's sister) and younger daughter(Mrinal Jadhav).\u00a0 The coziness of his family is shattered one night following an offhand chain of events.Vijay's character development is myriad throughout the film and it compels you to think away from the extreme principles of black vs white,\u00a0 right vs wrong, yin vs yang.\u00a0 His strong will and steadfastness to protect his family at all costs forms the backbone of the story.The unfateful night's chain of events leads to a massive police search headed by the stern and steely IPS Meera Deshmukh (Tabu).Tabu's acting is top-notch in multiple interrogation\u00a0 scenes throughout the movie with a distinct no-nonsense persona on display at all times.Ishita Dutta is remarkable in her Bollywood debut with a wide palette of emotions. Mrinal Jadhav plays the role of the innocent and adorable younger daughter splendidly, generating a few interspersed audience laughs.Rajat Kapoor has a knack for playing the upper-class, businessmen \u2013roles and is casted perfectly as Tabu's husband. However his character is a bit monochromatic, probably due to the script.The movie has multiple twists arousing the curiosity of the audience culminating into a superb climax.Even though the film is 2 hours and 43 minutes long, it binds the audience to their seats till the very last scene.I strongly recommend this film, especially to the thriller genre lovers.P.S.

The first half gives you a beautiful picture about the characters, how they are simple, funny, trying to meet ends and commoner. Just before the interval you get a glimpse of the story and how it is going to screw everything up.Second half is just an intellectual battle between Tabu and Ajay. How they try to out do one another. The climax is brilliant.Ajay makes up for the time he was away from serious movies and excels scene by scene, Shriya is gorgeous and does well too.

Last but not least, Mr. Devgan has done a good job as a father who goes out of his ways to protect his family.If you are a Tabu fan, you would regret if you miss this movie.

                "Just came back from the Premier Screening of Drishyam. The reason for me to catch the movie was the reviews of the original Drishyam which is a Malyalam movie with Mohanlal as the lead actor. The trailers of this Hindi remake with powerful existence of Ajay Devgan (or Devgn, as he writes it now) and Tabu, motivated me to go for this movie after a tiring Thursday in office, (mentioning the tiring day as disappointment was the last this I was willing to accept after the day, Glad I chose this movie). So the movie starts with a small happy family of Vishal Salgaonkar which is living happily in the ever happy town of Goa, there family was disrupted because of an unwanted person entering into their lives who happens to be the son of the Inspector general of Goa, Meera Deshmukh, then an accident happens which changes the life of this family for ever. The way this 4th grade failed person (Vishal) plays with the police department is commendable. So the movie is about how actually Vishal safeguard his family and himself against powerful Meera and her Police Department.My special suggestion is to have patience and sit for the first half of the movie as nothing much will happen but the story will be built up. After the interval when you come back with that tub of popcorn, its then the real investigation and the never ending plot of Vishal to safeguard his family starts, the proceedings will sometimes give you goose bumps and at times you will expect something to happen which will not happen and hence the tag line of the move \"Visuals Can Be Deceptive\" The Camera work of the movie is good. it features some of the beautiful locations of Goa (I am not sure if all of that was Goa) The acting done by the whole Salgaonkar family is superb along with Tabu's never disappointing appearance in front of the camera. The movie has limited songs, Two, actually, if I remember correctly, but both the tracks are good and perfectly goes with the situation. The side characters in the movie are also done by good actors and so they mix in the screenplay very meticulously. Overall, Its 100% worth a watch on this weekend, so go ahead book your tickets and go for it, I am sure you wont be disappointed, specially people who like Ajay Devgn on screen should go for this movie for sure.",

                "Well, visuals can indeed be deceptive. When the maker knows what he wants to present, you know you are in for an absolute treat. And for the ones who haven't seen the South Indian make of this movie, like me, are in for a masterpiece. Drishyam is inspired from a Japanese novel The Devotion of Suspect X & has been adopted into various languages in movies. When the roots have already been built, it is about proper presentation in a particular amount of time which is where Nishikant Kamat and his team come out triumphant. The best part about this movie is that it was presented and portrayed with utmost perfection in a manner in which the makers wanted it to be shown. The buildup was slow but every aspect was properly covered with enough evidence to win the audience. Suddenly, after a poor 1st half of 2015, Bollywood is coming up with tremendous flicks. It was the emotional journey of Bajrangi Bhaijaan 2 weeks back, critically acclaimed Masaan(I haven't seen it) last week and the gripping Drishyam now. Coming to the story, it is about the family of Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) ,his wife (Shriya Saran) ,his elder daughter Anju (Ishita Dutta) and the younger daughter Anu. Vijay is a 4th fail illiterate (as has been emphasized a lot in the movie) who lives a happy and satisfied life. He has his own cable service and he loves, watches, uses the scenes in movies in real life. Life takes a turn when the elder daughter (adopted) encounters a sad incident while on a School Nature Camp. This is the bitter reality of life:- We become culprit for no fault of ours and evil intentions of few spoilt rich. It was a mischief by a boy called Sam which came back to haunt the Salgaonkar family. Now, the only aim of Vijay is to protect his family from the police. It was to save themselves from blushes of the incident. But they were up against a tough & scary(I mean threatening) Inspector General (IG) Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) who was inclined to find the truth, after all Sam was her son. The way the planning is done, the manner in which it is portrayed, the confidence with which the family handles tough interrogations, the way the sequences are shown is all just perfect. Hats off to the original writer Jeetu Joseph, he left no stone unturned. The adaptation by Upendra Sidhaye is really good with a few changes here and there. The story unfolds wholly in Goa. The writing & script was so good that for me, it easily comes up amongst the best Bollywood has ever had. And the way Nishikant Kamat has handled it is simply phenomenal. The less said the better for Nishikant Kamat who has won my heart with such a wonderful vision and achieving the ultimate goal through this vision. You might feel that the pace is slow in the 1st half, but it doesn't bore you as its gripping. Some of the sequences are just scintillating especially after the arrival of Tabu. We have seen ample of movies regarding catching the criminal but this one is different, it's about saving the family. Will Vijay succeed? Or will Meera find out the truth? Watch it in a cinema theatre near you to find out. Direction by Nishikant Kamat is stupendous. It was an immense pleasure watching the movie on a Thursday night Premiere. When audience shouts and applaud towards the end, you know that the movie has won. Quite a lot of credit has to go to the casting director Vicky Sidana for coming up with a tremendous blend of actors. Apart from the big guns, it was the superb selection of supporting cast of Rajat Kapoor(Meera's husband), Ishita Dutta, Kamlesh Sawant (Inspector Gaetonde), Martin Uncle(Owner of Martin's cafe) etc. In such thriller movies, editing is a key aspect & with Aarif Sheikh, you know he will set it up perfectly & he did. Cinematography by Avinash Arun is also really good with the frames being simple yet catchy and beautiful rendition of Goa.There are just 2 songs comprising of the evergreen duo of Vishal Bharadwaj and Gulzar Saab but music isn't what matters in this movie. It's the haunting & terrifying back ground music by Sameer Phaterpekar which makes you deeply involved. I would specially like to point out the background music during the interrogation involving Tabu with her deadly eyes & the haunting music.Coming to the performances, Ajay Devgn delivers a phenomenal performance, one that will be remembered. His eyes speak a lot & he lived the character of Vijay Salgaonkar. Tabu is simply outstanding as Meera, playing the role of a tough cop & a concerned mother. She chooses her roles wisely and delivers a great performance most of the times. Shriya Saran is too young to play a mother but she also performs wonderfully well. She had a couple of difficult scenes and she did it really well. Debutant Ishita Dutta is someone whom I have seen earlier in the serial Ek Ghar Banaunga & I knew she would make it to Bollywood. She makes a really good debut. Rajat Kapoor is at his fluent best as he usually is. The younger daughter also does a decent job. But its Inspector Kamlesh Sawant who impressed me a lot, he was simply sensational. Martin's cafe plays a crucial part in this movie and so does Martin uncle. Others were brilliant as well.All in all, Drishyam is a perfectly made movie which won me over. For me, it was flawless. I would rate it 4.5/5.",

                "Drishyam- Less are the cases present in any film industry where a film is made with brilliant piece of writing (By Jeethu Joshep in case of this movie)and every other thing just revolve around it. Drishyam was one of those cases. One thing i would like to clear before you watch the movie is that this is not a suspense movie. It has been wrongly promoted same as happened in case of Aamir Khan's TALAASH. But yes its a part family movie and a part thriller. From the very start culprit will be in front of your eyes , but its hard to prove. Its all about how deep the truth has been dumped and how difficult its gonna be dig it out. To say about the plot will ruin the movie. Like the trailer shows Vijay(Ajay) is a very good man , with a golden heart , but somehow his family is being caught by the police to prove that they have kidnapped the son of Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) a cop. After that starts a thrilling ride in which Meera want evidence to prove Vijay and his family guilty , and Vijay will do anything to save his family as he say - \"EK INSAAN KE LIYE USKI FAMILY HI SABKUCH HOTI HEI AUR UNHE BACHANE KE LIYE WO KISI BHI HADD TAK JA SAKTA HEI\". The character of Vijay literally lived up to this quote of himself . But the movies seeks for your patience . The first half up to the crime happens was a little too stretchy. Length of 2hr and 43min for a thriller is too long. Some editing was needed on the first half. Although i personally didn't find anything boring , as it was good with light moments , making base for title characters , some good humour and a nicely picturized song CARBON COPY. Still its true that some editing could have made it better. Its like a tasty cake has been made but the Cherry was missing. But wait , the cherry has been provided by the 2nd half. For me which compensate all the minor errors of first half. You couldn't imagine how the writer has managed to write such a plot with so much details of investigation and specially the interrogations. This movie has some of the best interrogation scenes which Bollywood haven't shown us till now. Nishikant Kamat is one hell of a director. His land marks includes 1. making movies in 3 languages 2. have directed the highest grossing Marathi film. 3. Is very good with remakes - first FORCE and now this one. 4. Lastly he can dig out acting out of John Abraham. And any director who can make John Abraham act , is a great director for me. Nisikant truly amazes me with showing how good he can control intense scenes. Ajay Devgan shines again in a serious role. He brings all the seriousness to the character and also provide some comic moments on the first half. The character he played has made some decisions with ethical difficulties , which could be right from someone's eyes and can also be wrong in someone else's view. Vijay makes us believe that his decisions were right for the situation and any person would have done such things for safe guarding his family. About Tabu , she is one of the greatest actress Bollywood have. She doesn't have any comparison . Only rivalry she had or have or will have is she herself. As cop she was tough , and you cant imagine how tough she was. You have to watch it to know how she mixes up her emotions of being the mother of the victim with the emotions of a tough cop who is investigating the same case. About Shreya Saran , i love her smile. And i missed that smile since i had seen her in Awarapan. Although she didn't get much of the meaty role but she was decent as Ajay's wife. Same goes for Rajat Kapoor as Tabu's husband. Some unique cinematography has been done , as the movie shows Goa not from a tourist point of view but from a resident's point of view. Vishal Bhardawaj as music director was OK as he doesn't get much chance to impose good songs in the movie but the background score by Sameer Phatarpekar was brilliant. Yes i have to cut some marks for a stretchy first half , but m going with 7.7/10 which is not bad at all. The thing i said for PIKU i would like to repeat for this is that there exist no reasons why should anyone not watch this movie except in case you have seen the original one. Just one request , DON'T EXPECT ANY SUSPENSE , be patient and FLOW WITH THE INTENSITY. By ANuP APu KuMaR.",

                "Drishyam, literally meaning 'visuals', is a Hindi-language crime mystery thriller about a upper middle-class family that comes under the scrutiny of police when they're suspected of murder of a young man who has powerful ties with the local authorities. Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn), the father, must do everything he can to keep his family from going to prison, utilizing every legal and illegal trick he has learned as a lifelong movie buff.A fine example of how a good script can elevate a movie. Because to be honest the acting is not a strength of this film. Devgn is very good, which helps a lot, as is Tabu as Inspector General Meera Deshmukh, but all the rest are either rather wooden or a bit too over the top.But that doesn't really matter because it's really a movie about Devgn's character and how he continuously outsmarts the police. The greatest thrill of the film is finding out just how long he can keep up the juggling act without Tabu's character finally nailing him to the wall.And it's a good juggling act. The classic crime thrillers are more about \"who did it\", but this is a great example of a smaller subgenre tentatively called \"will they get caught\". And in executing the conventions of that subgenre is where this film shines.Recommended. Especially if you're looking for a Hindi film that's about more than singing, dancing and jumping around.",

                "With all honesty, the Hindi version of DRISHYAM gives me no energy to write about it in details being the weakest 4th remake of the original Malayalam film featuring Mohan Lal in the lead. Using a fresh backdrop and a local feel it has got its impressive moments that obviously come in the final hour when the proceedings become high paced, intense and brutal too with police interrogation crossing all its extreme limits at the orders of its own IG. But at the same time, it doesn't make any change in its slow first half, following the fixed format that was also pointed out as the weaker portions of the original by few critics. Still, despite the not so happening first hour, one might like it as a crime thriller that doesn't allow the viewers to move in its concluding hour, offering many unexpected twists and turns keeping them thoroughly engrossed. However it's the missing emotions, lack of energy or fire, average performances, a loud-inconsistent background score, avoidable spoon- feeding and few unnecessary (ridiculous) commercial insertions that don't let you rate the film more than anything above average or decent. Thankfully they use only two songs out of four (in the soundtrack) as required but fail to en-cash on the emotional aspect of the script that should ideally have been its key feature becoming a 'family- thriller'.As a bitter truth, the theme of the film didn't require any kind of philosophical soundtrack both Vishal and Gulzar are known for. The weak acts of Shriya Saran, kids and more contribute a lot in its feeble impact. Plus confirming my doubts Ajay Devgn remains a miscast in the role of a clever minded, cinema loving father guarding his small family. Moreover the most disappointing feature remains Tabu, who doesn't come up with anything even close to what was being expected quite surprisingly, whereas Kamlesh Sawant as the cruel sub- inspector scores the most.In comparative terms, it seems DRISHAYM (Hindi) has been made hurriedly in some kind of available time with the star or team, without giving any major emphasis on solid characterizations as seen in the original. In clear words, where in all the four regional films, the actors seem like sinking deep into their given characters, the Hindi version has them all doing it as another of their professional assignment standing in front of the camera with no home-work done of any sort to play their given roles. Mentioning it specifically I didn't find any concerning FATHER in Ajay Devgn or a MOTHER in either Shriya or Tabu disappointingly, that was supposed to be the main requirement of the script as my personal conclusion. So would suggest to go for the original Malayalam film first if you wish to enjoy the subject more in the right manner. Note: Hope after DRISHYAM many passionate Hindi filmgoers get enlightened that in reality our Indian Regional movies and makers are miles ahead than the present mainstream Hindi Cinema in all respects.",

There is NO police in the world that can do that. There was no evidence, no witnesses, not even hint to suggest that the family was guilty, yet the detective just \"knew\" that they were guilty. Makes zero sense at all.It's also ridiculous how the detective says \"we can't put them through a lie detector test without a court order\" but she has no problem torturing them in police station.

I have not seen the latter so I can't make the comparison (but I have just found out that the Tamil movie with English subtitles is on YouTube ... Yeah!).Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) runs a cable TV network in a remote and hilly village of Goa. He lives a happy life with his wife Nandini and two daughters. A 4th grade dropout & an orphan, Vijay has worked his way towards success with his sheer hard-work & street smartness in order to provide for his family who mean the world to him. A man of few means & needs; Vijay believes life is to be lived simplistically - his wife, while she loves him devoutly, wants Vijay's thrifty & miserly behavior to end and wants the world for her family. If there's one thing that Vijay cannot live without, it is his passion for watching films. Such is his 'filmy' obsession that he doesn't mind staying up all night at his office binging on TV movies! In a bizarre turn of events; a teenage boy goes missing; he is the son of a headstrong & no-nonsense cop; IG Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) and the Salgaonkar family is the prime suspect! Will a humble & middle class man, be able to protect his family from oppression of the powerful? How the family weathers the storm that ensues during the violent investigation forms the rest of the story leading to an unexpected & shocking climax.Drishyam is a riveting entertainer. The first half lays the foundation for a rip-roaring second half and it didn't disappoint. The cast is great with Ajay Devgn leading the ultimate \"how to get away with murder\" plot line. We are treated to his ultimate foe in Tabu who has the killer look to match her crime brain. Elsewhere, I really enjoy watching Rajat Kapoor who plays Tabu's husband. His character moves in brilliant counterpoint to Tabu's relentless pursuit for the answer. Love the superb cat and mouse games and how the tables keep turning till we were tearing our hair off, but everything hits the groove and reaches a satisfying climax.Drishyam could have been a classic but several creative choices baffled me. The humour in the first half feels laboured and forced. How it paints the family of four is too obvious to me. But thankfully I love watching Vijay who is a character after my heart. He loves watching action movies, law and crime dramas, and the accumulated wealth of knowledge help lay the path of deceit and red herrings for the police. He is a character that is very easy to root for. Tabu also puts in a superb shift and it is easy to believe in her smarts, but it is her cold cruelty that puts a shiver in my heart. Overall, I find the writing couldn't match up with the characters and story, and it felt very \"by the numbers\" rudimentary to me. In more capable hands the shades of the characters would have been more layered and the theme of wrong versus wronged shining forth. Fans of the Japanese film Suspect X will find this quite familiar but thankfully with a good mixing up of elements and locale. As it is, it comes off just as a solid piece of entertainment than superb character studies.",

Director is Nishikant Kamat who gave us Mumbai Meri Jaan(2008) and FORCE(remake of Kaakha Kaakha) The film almost just replicates the original Drishyam almost scene to scene with a few minor changes, like the religion In the original Mohanlal was a catholic, here Ajay is a hindu(thankfully no artificial catholic character), Also in place of going for a retreat there go for a Ashram trip. The film is set in Goa, thankfully no focus on beaches and bars.etc yet there are some stereotypes like the character of Martin who runs Martins corner, he offers the cop a beer at breakfast.

Yes, the film takes some time to pick up so as to provide some background of the characters and establish some familiarity with their everyday life, but when it gets past that, it's one hell of a ride.I'm sure the scenes with the guy who comes to visit with the phone in his hands and the mother and daughter's pleas to take mercy on them will throw some people off. In many ways this scene seems to be taken right from a primitive masala film of the 1980s. It takes great cultural perspective to understand this sentiment if you are removed from that mindset.But once it's done, the film is a treat all through. The proceedings, turns and twists are absolutely fun to watch and there's hardly a dull moment after some point. Yes, there are some exaggerations here and there, and some of the slow-motion sequences are amusing as is some of the scores, but everything is within context and these do not damage the overall product.Ajay Devgan, as always, is tremendous. Credible, real, charismatic and enjoyably subdued in his mission. Shriya Saran is stunningly beautiful as his wife. Tabu is always a great addition and when she gets a role like this one, which she shows to be equally good at, she is a delight.

Not only does it keep you on your toes throughout but it makes you chew your nails in between. A thriller of the highest quality! This could be India's answer to 'Gone Girl' (2014), or even better I would say.One important point was to make the public side with the hero and his family and to sort of create an understanding for everything that he had done. This of course wouldn't have been possible if they had shown it as just some deliberate murder, or had shown a completely innocent guy being murdered. So that was quite smart.This film is all about self-confidence, trust in one's ability and about sticking to your decision come what may. I have gone through something somewhat similar to this in my life a few years ago, although I wasn't the one accused and neither was I on the wrong side - even more similarly to this film, perhaps no one was entirely on the wrong side - and add one more similarity, the only person on the wrong side had not intended for things to escalate to this much as that person was on the play trying to achieve some other goal. It's amazingly mind-blowing seeing the similarities! A bit sad that I can't elaborate much on the story to explain how similar things were, from character to character! Not to imply that I am as smart as the hero was, but I have one stunningly striking similarity from my very life with this film, and something that my friends often find hard to believe. To come to the point, all my English is based on what I had started from news channel and the commentary of cricket matches, then to the Internet and hence the articles etc. read online. Add to this learning very good, pure Hindi from online dictionaries and Urdu from reading the news-slide on Pakistani news channels. Add to this I am a complete film freak! Alone in July I have watched 23 films! So quite a few similarities there.",

            "In the 1950s, fear and violence escalate as the people of Algiers fight for independence from the French government.",
            "A film commissioned by the Algerian government that shows the Algerian revolution from both sides. The French foreign legion has left Vietnam in defeat and has something to prove. The Algerians are seeking independence. The two clash. The torture used by the French is contrasted with the Algerian&#39;s use of bombs in soda shops. A look at war as a nasty thing that harms and sullies everyone who participates in it.",
            "In 1954, the National Liberation Front of Algiers shots many French policemen beginning a movement for the independence of their country; in return, the Chief of Police plants a bomb in the Arab quarter, killing many dwellers. The NLF sends three women with bombs to two bars and the Air France office in the European quarter, killing many people. The French government sends the military forces under the command of the abusive Colonel Mathieu that does not respect the human rights and uses torture to destroy the NLF command. In 1962, the Algerians finally achieve their aimed independence.",
            "1954. France, after the independence of the nations comprising Indochina, turns its attention to incidents in French Algeria, which they have ruled for approximately one hundred thirty years. The National Liberation Front (FLN) is leading the resistance in Algeria against their colonial rulers, the FLN who the French authorities believe, or want to believe, comprise only a small minority of the Muslim Algerian population in wanting Algerian independence. Specific incidents in this battle in Algiers between 1954 and the time of independence in 1962 are presented. The FLN began their campaign in shooting military police in the Casbah, the predominantly Muslim quarter of the city, as they were able to blend back into the scene with the support of the populace. These initial one by one attacks escalated on both sides to mass killings, where collateral damage was seen as being acceptable. Both sides also worked toward the United Nations discussion on the issue, each wanting global support for their cause. The events largely focus on two people, one on each side. The first is Ali La Pointe, a lifelong petty criminal and illiterate who the FLN recruited after being politicized while in prison. The second is French paratrooper Colonel Mathieu, a lead French strategist whose main goal is to dismantle the FLN activities by &quot;cutting off the head of the tapeworm&quot;.",
            "Filmed in a semi-documentary format, this film deals with the battle of Algiers (1956-57) part of the broader fight for Algerian independence (1954-62) from French colonial rule. The rebels began their attacks by shooting policeman and other government officials. When they start bombing public places in the European sector - caf\u00e9s, restaurants, the Air France office - the authorities send in crack military units. Through large-scale arrests and torture, the colonel in charge focuses on locating and eliminating the leaders of the movement."

        "synopsis": "The opening scene is of a man who has presumably been tortured by some French military personnel. The commander (Col. Mathieu played by Jean Martin) enters and tells the man to put on a French uniform. The man sheds a tear. He is obviously being forced into something he doesnt want to do. In the next scene you have the commander again speaking to some young men who are hidden in a wall. Ali is obviously going to be a main character. We see him running through the streets. Some French young men trip him. Ali is a bit of a hot head and smashes the French boys face.\nWe see a man in a prison being beheaded with the guillotine. Ali witnesses this.\nCut to Ali (played by Brahim Hadjadj) being approached by a young boy with a note. He is given instructions on how to carry out a terrorist plot. He is tricked into shooting a French officer but the gun was empty. He meets one of the leaders of the resistance movement, the Jaffar. In the next scene a drunken man is beaten by a bunch of little kids.\nIn the next scene Ali shoots a middle-aged man.\nA FLN wedding is performed. The French put them in charge of civic affairs but it seemed like a religious wedding.\nAli appears to be among a group of young men who infiltrate the police headquarters and kill several police personnel. This is only the beginning of a series of attacks against the police. There are casualties on both sides.\nThe women use their outward signs of piety (burkas) to hide weapons. A group of women dress up like western women. Bombs are distributed. The women go into the French sectoran area that looks as though it may have been pulled out of Paris with fashionably dressed people, sidewalk caf\u00e9s and people enjoying their leisure time.\nThe French respond to all of the Terrorist activities with a show of force. For a moment the commandant looks like an Amway salesman describing what is exactly like a multilevel marketing scheme in his explanation of a terrorist cell. The FLN is ordered to strike but the French have a hidden agenda to find out whom the resistance fighters might be. The French captain is very cleaver to know that the insurrection would come after the terrorist bombings.\nAnother bombing at a crowded horse race: Some of the French adults attack an Algerian child.\nThere are two scenes with reporters asking questions. In the first one a high-level resistance fighter is questioned. In the second, the captain is confronted with some difficult questions. One of the things they are asked about is if they use torture. The captain answers in a diplomatic manner and then the audience sees several acts of brutal torture with the Algerians as the victims.\nIn the closing scene we see the captain negotiating with the resistance fighters who want a written promise that they will have a fair trial if they surrender. The fighters ask him to send it up in a basket. The resistance fighters send a basket containing a bomb. It explodes killing or injuring at least one soldier. Jaffar is captured but Ali is still at large.\nThe closing scene shows Ali with his friends. They hear soldiers coming and all but the woman hide in the wall-hiding place. The French soldiers plant a bomb outside the hiding place. We saw this scene before at the beginning of the movie. Apparently the Algerian we saw in the opening scene who shed a tear led the French to Ali. The bomb explodes.\nThe final scene takes place some time later in 1960. There is a riot going on with soldiers shooting into the crowds. The film ends with the captain narrating that on July 2, 1962 a new nation of Algeria was born.",

                "Perhaps no other cinematic depiction of revolt against colonial rule is so detailed, vivid, and specific as the 1965 Battle of Algiers (La battaglia di Algeri, just reissued in a new print and having limited distribution in the US). It's a vivid and very specific recreation of the insurrection against the French in Algiers in the late Fifties that shows how the French systematically eradicated that insurrection. It's also a story repeated with variations in dozens of parts of the globe now, as then. But as I'm not the first to note, it's neither a partisan tract nor a user manual. It was therefore foolish of the Pentagon to watch it recently as if tips on how to control Iraqi `resistance'/'terrorism' were to be found in it, and it has been equally foolish of the Black Panthers or other revolutionaries to watch it seeking tactical information for their struggles. Those tactics did not succeed; but neither did the effort to quell the independence movement: the French won the battle but lost the war. A process that might have proceeded peacefully in a matter of months, takes years to happen. The film documents the sad foolishness of solving conflicts with violence, the maximum loss and suffering on both sides and the protraction of the inevitable outcome.\nThe insurrection The Battle of Algiers describes was effectively quelled through the leadership of the bold, methodical French Colonel Mathieu, who as we see succeeds in eliminating the organizational structure of the resistance, `triangle' by `triangle', using torture to ferret out names and locations of the autonomous `terrorists'/'partisans,' then killing the `head' of the `worm' their structure represents so it can't `regenerate.' Once this happens, after a merciless French campaign following a general strike, the sympathizers in the majority Algerian population are totally demoralized; but two years later a vigorous national independence movement `suddenly,' `spontaneously,' springs forth, and not long afterward France has to grant Algerian independence. It's at this point, rather than at the moment of Mathieu's momentary triumph, that the film ends.\nGillo Pontecorvo undertook his masterpiece after prodding from the resistance leader, Saadi Yacef, but he made a film equally sympathetic toward and critical of both sides. We see as much of the French dissection of the situation and repression of it (by the police chief, then Colonel Mathieu) as we see of the `terrorists'/'partisans' planning and execution of their actions. We see Colonel Mathieu as an appealing macho hero with moments of noble fair play, a shades-wearing, cigarette puffing veteran who moves around with clarity, honesty, and panache; he himself has a `partisan' background. The `terrorist'/'rebel' leaders are serious, intensely committed men of various types, from the sophisticated intellectual to the young firebrand. There are no `heroes' here; or, alternately, if you like, they're all `heroes.'Mathieu appears before the press beside the captured `rebel'/'terrorist' leader - an unusual move in itself - and expresses his respect for the man's courage and conviction. The `rebel' leader in this scene is eloquent in defending `terrorist'/'rebellion' methods such as the use of baskets filled with explosives in public places. `Give us your bombs and we'll give you our baskets.' Mathieu for his part effectively explains to the journalists the necessity of torture to short circuit the `rebellion'/'terrorism'. After this explanation, the film, typically systematic at this point, begins showing a series of tortures of Algerians being carried out.\nThe first image we see in the film is the shattered face and body of the small, tortured Algerian man who's broken down and revealed where Ali `La Pointe,' the firebrand, the last remaining leader, is hiding. Then we see the `terrorist'/'terrorist' leader Ali and his closest supporters trapped like deer in their hideaway, their faces soft and beautiful. The splendid black and white photography works like William Klein's Fifties and Sixties images (he's one of the key visual commentators of that period stylistically) to powerfully capture the edgy soulfulness of the North African people and their gritty Casbah milieu. Much of the film's power comes from the way Pontecorvo was able to work, through Saadi Yacef, directly in the Casbah among the real people - as Fernando Meirelles worked in the favelas of Brazil recently with local boys to forge the astonishing City of God.The voices, which are dubbed, as was the fixed Italian filmmaking style, work somewhat less effectively because of obvious disconnects between mouth and sound at times, but the French is so analytical and the Algerians' Arabic so exotic-sounding (even to a student of Arabic) that they work, and the insistent, exciting music composed by Pontecorvo himself in collaboration with Ennio Morricone is a powerful element in the film's relentless forward movement.The fast rhythms of the editing are balanced by the stunning authenticity of the hundreds of Algerian extras who swarm across the screen: it's in the crowd scenes that The Battle of Algiers really sings. There are many superb sequences of street fighting, of people massing at checkpoints, of the French victims innocently assembled in public places; and like an exhilarating coda there is the scene of joyous victory as Algerians celebrate their independence in the last blurry moments. This is a film (again, like City of God) of almost intoxicating -- and nauseating -- violence, complexity, and fervor. Pontecorvo's accomplishment, though, is the way through showing the leaders analyzing and debating the action he freezes any impulse toward partisanship in its tracks. The evenhandedness of the coverage works a Brechtian `Alienation Effect' so you don't get caught up in rooting for one side or the other.The sequence of three pretty Algerian women carrying out an operation is a particularly memorable one -- but only one among many. First they take off their burqas and cut their hair and doll themselves up French style and then they get past the checkpoint into the French quarter to leave handbags full of explosives in a bar, a dance club, and an airport lounge. Again close-ups of faces in the bar and the jive dancers with jaunty jabbing elbows in the club show a brilliant use of image and classic editing: first the innocent, vulnerable faces, then the explosions. Here our sympathies for the French victims are fully awakened. Another sequence of Algerians removing bodies from a building has all the power and sadness of Christ's Passion.\nThere's no point where as in a conventional thriller we feel excitement and sympathy for the perpetrator, because we see the cruelty of the perpetrator and the humanity of the victim every time. The Battle of Algiers is a final triumphant use of Italian cinematic neorealismo. The killing is observed neutrally, but with sadness, as part of a stupid game caused by ignorance and played out compulsively when a political settlement would have been infinitely better - a stupid game observed with astonishing zest.\nRevived thirty-five years later in a new 35-mm. print, its grainy beauty pristinely vivid, The Battle of Algiers remains a superbly made machine that plays out the addictive game of `terrorism,' repression, torture, revolt, and full-fledged insurrection as effectively now as when it was first issued. Like any classic, it's of its time and of all time. There's a lesson here, but it's not for partisans or colonialists: it's for all people.",

                "In 1962 after more than 130 years of French colonial rule, Algeria became independent.  Gillo Pontecorvo's `Algiers' shows the decade leading to that liberation in a powerful story about Muslims asserting their rights through violence, hiding, and plotting in the Kasbah, a demiworld of narrow, winding, seemingly endless alleys that are the only protection the rebels have from the eyes of the French.  The re-release of the 1965 black and white film is a convincing story of a people who do not want to be occupied and will give their lives so their families can one day be free.The story centers on a couple of Muslim leaders, the charismatic Col. of the French forces, and the bombings and shootouts that at one point averaged just over 4 per day. The film's sympathy is for the Muslims, but the Colonel has moments of reflection that could be sympathetic, especially with the revelation that he was a member of the resistance in WWII and may have suffered in a concentration camp. The director shows the influence of Italian neo-realists like Roberto Rossellini (`Paisan') by shooting in documentary style on location, using non-actors (except for the Colonel), and generally avoiding an agitprop angle.But the film's sympathy in the end belongs to the occupied people.  When 3 rebel women change appearance to look French, infiltrate, and plant bombs, the irony obvious to American audiences in their current struggle is a tribute to the strength of the narration and characterization and the universal dislike of occupation and subjugation.The torture of the Muslim prisoners is the most poignant relevance to the recent scandal in Iraq.  The Colonel's justification for the practice to gain life-saving information is classic `ends-justify-the-means' logic still being used by great nations. In fact, the Pentagon reportedly had seen this film during the first days of the second Iraq War; some say they learned nothing from the film, which is an unforgettable study of occupation and defeat.",

                "\"Battle of Algiers\" is simply one of the greatest films every made.  If film making can be about truth as well as fantasy, then a movie that includes a title card telling viewers that there is not one foot of documentary or newsreel footage in it must deserve viewing.\"Battle of Algiers\" contains scenes that seem so real, you suspect that they couldn't have been staged.  When three Algerian women come down from the Casbah to plant bombs in the French quarter of the city, you can almost cut the tension with a knife.  When the bombs go off, you think they must have been real bombs.  And when you see the devastation they leave in their wake, you cannot fail to be moved.  The massive rebellion in the streets at the end of the film also seems so real, you sit wondering how many extras must have been injured filming those scenes.\"Battle of Algiers\" combines brilliant photography, crisp direction, an intriguing plot and some very fine acting. Throw in a terrific music score, splendid editing, impressive special effects and the best example ever of docudrama style production and you have a masterpiece of film making.But film making is not nearly as important as human life and no film in general release today says more about America's current involvement in the middle east and many other parts of the world than this picture about the French in Algeria, made more than three decades ago.Every American should view this film, then think about our current occupation of Iraq.",

If a film has better captured the harsh and ugly realities that are an inevitable part of a true revolutionary movement, I never saw it.

It was depressing to see this movie in Berkeley in the early 70s, and hear the audience cheer the \"heroic\" Algerian revolutionaries while booing the \"villainous\" French, in view of the great pains that had been taken to present a balanced viewpoint.

It does not attempt to show us the entire war but centers on the city of Algiers. Even though you are told at the beginning that no documentary footage is used it is at times hard to believe as many of the images you see have a stark and often unsettling reality to them. Considering that this was a co production between Algeria and Italy the film is remarkable in that it does not turn itself a political tirade by taking sides. Instead the camera is a sort of neutral observer allowing us to witness events that spiraled from individual demonstrations to a full scale war of savage intensity. French officers who fought the Nazis a few years before degenerated into the mode of their former enemy while Algerians had no problems exploding bombs that would kill their own people. The camera shows no heros or villains but humanity in its darkest forms. This is a powerful film with superb direction and cinematography.

                "As this film unfolds, we have a sense that things are happening before our very eyes. The movie is so documentary-like as to seem like a stationary camera has been set up in the midst of turmoil. The French imperialists are the reason all this is happening. Obviously, years of \"rule\" make the day to day existence hard to change. Do all the Algerians want an overthrow of French rule? Probably not. Maybe not even a majority. As the rebels blow up restaurants and airport waiting rooms, the police are torturing the rebels. It becomes a cesspool of the lowest form of human degradation. And yet, what else can be the answer when a single entity has such a foothold and ultimate military power. As is usually the case, attrition does the job. With our current situation in the Mideast and Afghanistan, will we find ourselves reproducing what happened to the Russians? Unfortunately, there are no easy answers because the fight is against oppression. The kicker is that there is so much human and economic expense involved in these situations that often it takes centuries. We need to ask ourselves what is gained and one cannot put a price on the human soul.

                "Battle of Algiers might well be the best historical film ever. It stands out as a splendid work of art, as an extremely accurate depiction of a specific time and place, as a political hymn to independence, and as a thought-provoking philosophical reflection on violence, and on the relationship between ends and means.It depicts the crucial years 1956-1957 in the Algerian war of independence from French colonial rule: the leaders of the independentist FLN decide to make Algiers a battlefield through strikes and terrorism in order to shake colonialism and to unite Algerians. The French respond to this urban guerilla with a ruthless control of space, separating European and Arab (the 'casbah') parts of the city, and with a brutal hunt of the FLN leaders through the torture of lesser militants. The French paratroops under gen. Massu, col. Bigeard and cdt. Aussaresses (blended in the film into a synthetic and fictitious character, col. Mathieu) eventually 'win' the battle of Algiers, but they end up 'losing' Algeria, as their repression has only fueled nationalism. The film therefore ends with the vision of Algerian crowds demanding independence ('Istiql\u00e2l') as they march through the streets of Algiers in 1960.While this is an accurate enough analysis of such a complex war (even though interestingly de Gaulle is absent from the film as it intends to show how independence was conquered, not handed from above by French authorities) it is also a metaphor, as the film works on many different levels.It is a masterpiece of editing and cinematography. The combined use of space and music is stunning: when the french paratroops take possession of the Casbah, literally filling up the frame, gaining control of the streets, rooftops, hallways, courtyards, their superbly choreographed movements are underlined by a haunting theme by Morricone & director Pontecorvo. In these sequences he rivals not only Rossellini but Eisenstein.It is also strongly influenced by the New Wave in its manner of filming faces of protagonists. Some of the most beautiful moments in the film (as the beginning in Ali's hiding hole, or the scenes before the explosions in the bars) consist of protagonists' faces, victims, perpetrators, bystanders, shot in close up, in a beautiful black and white, without comment or voice-over: their common humanity is shown as well as the determination, the inner flame of those fighting for independence.I would disagree with other reviewers saying the movie is is unbiased: the film was commissioned and encouraged by the new-born Algerian state, and Yacef Saadi, a leader in the war of independence appears in prominent role. While the violence of both sides is coolly examined, the film justifies that of the Algerians, if only by showing (in a slightly dishonest way) that it always responds to the violence of the French. This question of precedence (who started to be inhuman?), though in the end quite pointless, has long poisoned mutual understanding between French and Algerian memories of the war. Another bias, explained by the FLN financing and staging, is the almost complete absence in the film of the middle ground, those neither in the terrorist FLN or in the paratroops, desiring to live in peace. They have existed, in both sides, as the examples of writer Albert Camus and his friend Mouloud Ferraoun show. This is quite understandable as it might not fit in the epic text depicted in realistic manner by Pontecorvo. However, in the film, the Algerians that are not committed to war are shown to be gangsters and pimps: this is a minor flaw of the film and its only touch of propaganda.All that said, the film is a stunning visual, historical and ethical masterpiece. Sadly and ironically, it capture a fiery desire for liberty at the very time (1965) a military coup by Boumediene overthrew Ben Bella in Algeria, repressing liberties for the decades to come. Most of all, it is one of the most potent depictions of and reflections on violence (in the twin and extreme forms of terrorism and torture) to be seen on screen.The most powerful image of the film remains the vision of a FLN militant broken by torture and forced to confess the hiding place of his chief. His haunted look, exhausted stance, empty eyes, grotesquely dressed in a paratroops' uniform, stand as an indictment of colonialism.",

                "An impressive and historical film in semi-documentary style . Set when the Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale (FLN) is leading the resistance in Algeria against their French rulers , the FLN that the colonial authorities believe, or want to believe, comprise only a small minority of the Muslim Algerian population in wanting Algerian independence. Subsequently , specifically violent incidents taking place in the battle in Algiers -between 1954 and the final time of independence in 1962- are introduced . The final scene happens some time later in 1960. There is a riot going on with soldiers shooting into the crowds. Finally , the \u00c9vian Accords were a set of peace treaties signed on 18 March 1962 in \u00c9vian-les-Bains, France, by France and the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, the government-in-exile of FLN, which sought Algeria's independence from France . The Accords ended the 1954-1962 Algerian War with a formal cease-fire proclaimed for 19 March and formalized the status of Algeria as an independent nation and the idea of cooperative exchanges between the two countries . The movie ends with the captain narrating that on July 2, 1962 a new nation of Algeria was born . The French Colonel...who was forced even to torture ! . One of the many women...who stopped at nothing to win! The Algerian Street Boy...who became a rebel hero!. The Revolt that Stirred the World!This seminal semi-documentary style film was well directed by Gillo Pontecorvo , who also participated in the script and the music (in this last aspect, advised by the great maestro Ennio Morricone) . The main characters were represented by Brahim Hadjadj , Yacef Sa\u00e2di and Jean Martin who was the only professional actor . The Battle of Algiers was inspired by the 1962 book Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger, an FLN military commander's account of the campaign, by Saadi Yacef . Yacef wrote the book while he was held as a prisoner of the French , and it served to boost morale for the FLN and other militants . After independence, the French released Yacef , who became a leader in the new government. The Algerian government backed adapting Yacef's memoir as a film . Salash Baazi , an FLN leader who had been exiled by the French, approached Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo and screenwriter Franco Solinas with the project . To meet the demands of film, The Battle of Algiers uses composite characters and changes the names of certain persons . For example , Colonel Mathieu is a composite of several French counterinsurgency officers , especially Jacques Massu . Saadi Yacef has said that Mathieu was based more on Marcel Bigeard , although the character is also reminiscent of Roger Trinquier . Accused of portraying Mathieu as too elegant and noble, screenwriter Franco Solinas denied that this was his intention . He said in an interview that the Colonel is \"elegant and cultured, because Western civilization is neither inelegant nor uncultured\". For The Battle of Algiers , Pontecorvo and cinematographer Marcello Gatti filmed in black and white and experimented with various techniques to give the film the look of newsreel and documentary film . The effect was so convincing that American releases carried a notice that \"not one foot\" of newsreel was used.Pontecorvo's use of fictional realism enables the movie \"to operate along a double-bind as it consciously addresses different audiences\" . The film makes special use of television in order to link western audiences with images they are constantly faced with that are asserted to express the \"truth\". The film seems to be filmed through the point of view of a western reporter, as telephoto lenses and hand-held cameras are used, whilst \"depicting the struggle from a 'safe' distance with French soldiers placed between the crowds and camera\" .La battaglia di Algeri (1966) is an excellent film which makes most political films seem intellectual by comparison in its use o of non-professional actors , realistic violence , gritty cinematography and a boldly propagandistic sense of social outrage . The motion picture was competently directed by Gillo Pontecorvo . Although Gillo made fewer than 20 films , he is regarded as one of Italy's greatest directors . He moved to France in 1938 to escape Italy's fascist racial laws . He eventually returned to Italy and led a Resistance brigade during WWII. After the war, he studied chemistry and worked as a journalist before becoming a film director; he started out making documentaries . His first feature film was \u00a8The Wide Blue Road\u00a8. Pontecorvo was born into a Jewish family , as he directed \u00a8Kapo\u00a8 that was one of the first films about the theme of Jewish holocaust and one of the more realistic in its recreation . Gillo subsequently directed this successful \u00a8Battle of Algiers\u00a8 and \u00a8Queimada\u00a8 with Marlon Brando and his final feature movie : \u00a8Ogro\u00a8 , later on , he made Documentaries and Shorts . This \u00a8The Battle of Algiers\u00a8 won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for three Academy Awards (in non-consecutive years, a unique achievement) : Best Foreign Language Film in 1967, and Best Screenplay (Gillo Pontecorvo and Franco Solinas) and Best Director (Gillo Pontecorvo) in 1969.",

He is recruited into the revolutionaries after spending 5 months in prison.This is most notable for how realistic this movie is. Taking the era into account, this is taking realism to the next level.

                "When Gillo Pontocorvo passed away in 2006, obituaries worldwide eulogized him as the man \"who directed THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS\", and did so for a very good reason. Fifty-seven years later it still remains the most incendiary political film of all time. Legend has it that prior to America's invasion of Iraq in 2003, THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS was privately screened at the Pentagon, supposedly as an instruction on how not to win over the hearts and minds of the people they're occupying. If that was their purpose, it certainly didn't work, because we all know how that debacle worked out.The foundation for THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS lays with a nonfiction account of the Algerian War for Independence written by Saadi Yacef, a former resistance fighter who was released from prison in 1962 following France's relinquishment of their North African colony. Almost immediately, Algeria's self-rule government was interested in immortalizing their struggle onto celluloid. Because they had no homegrown filmmaking talent to speak of, they approached Pontocorvo in Italy to see if he wanted to direct.During the Second World War, Pontocorvo was a Marxist member of Italy's Communist party who fought against Mussolini's Fascists. When the war was over, he drifted towards filmmaking, impressed with the neo-realist movement burgeoning in his country. The Algerian government felt that his anti-colonial beliefs, coupled with his flair for docudramas, made him a logical choice to direct THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS.Pontocorvo's screenwriter worked closely with Yacef, who was enjoying a taste of celebrity outside of Algeria due to his involvement with the movie. In addition to the script, Yacef also served as a co-producer and even took on an acting role (as Jafar). Taking a page from Vittorio DeSica's BICYCLE THIEVES, Pontocorvo chose to avoid using professional actors in favor of people with no acting experience at all. That included Brahim Haggiag, who played the lead role of Ali LaPointe.Movie watching experience has taught me that, for legal reasons, the names of real-life people whose lives are depicted are given pseudonyms. Or the protagonist is a composite character of more than one person. Therefore, I was quite surprised to learn that Ali LaPointe was, in fact, a real person. The first scene in THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS is in a room where French paratroopers have tortured a prisoner into revealing Ali's hideout. They descend into an apartment where the fugitive is hiding inside a secret room behind a false wall.Unlike the other Allies, France never found peace in the years after the Second World War. Locked into a bitter conflict with the Viet Minh, by 1954 they were on the verge of losing Vietnam (or Indochina), which had been a colonial outpost of theirs for over a century. And now, just across the Mediterranean, the French were being challenged in Algeria by the rebels' National Liberation Front (or FLN), who were seeking the same results as the Viet Minh. What followed was a bloody eight year struggle between France and the FLN over who was going to rule Algeria.After the opening credits, THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS flashes back three years to 1954, where Ali LaPointe is a parolee whose juvenile delinquency has graduated into adult criminal activity. The Algerian capital city is awash with French nationals and expats who bask in humiliating the natives, and when Ali is mercilessly taunted by a young student, he responds by bloodying his tormentor's nose.After serving a five month sentence for assault, Ali is approached by a boy acting as a liaison for the outlawed FLN. He's instructed to be at a specific location where an Arab woman will supply him with a revolver to shoot a patrolling French policeman. Doing as he's ordered, Ali pulls the trigger, only to discover the chamber is empty. This was a test by the FLN to test his loyalty and rule out his being an informer.Passing the test, Ali is recruited by Jafar, a guerilla lieutenant, to help organize revolt. But before they can take on the colonials, they must first clean house among Algiers' Arab population by eliminating any potential traitors among the locals. The usual suspects include drug addicts, prostitutes, pimps, and other purveyors of vice whose conduct runs contrary to Islamic code.By June of 1956, the insurgents are ready to strike. In one day alone, several French police officers are gunned down in separate incidents. The prefect responds to the armed insurrection by setting off a bomb in the Casbah neighborhood, killing many innocent people including children. The authorities have now crossed the Rubicon by targeting civilians, so now it's all out war! The FLN retaliated by planting explosives in caf\u00e9s, nightclubs, and other public venues frequented by Europeans.Realizing that that the gloves are now off, Paris is well aware that their police are outnumbered by an outraged populace that wants the occupiers out of Algeria. The paratroopers are sent in to quell the rebellion and restore order to Algiers....even if it means creating new enemies. With the noose slowly tightening around their operations, the insurgents risk losing the battle of Algiers. But since international opinion is squarely against France, Algeria is in a good position to win the war.Pontocorvo shot THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS in a grainy, harsh tone of black & white to create a newsreel effect. Of all the excellent moments in the movie, I thought his most arresting was when three Arab women set aside their traditional Muslim clothing, then apply lipstick and mascara, brush their hair, and don casual dress attire, all to make them appear more European. Carrying explosive devices inside their handbags, the ladies are easily able to pass through the various checkpoints and nonchalantly plant the bombs at the designated public places. The percussive tempo (by composer Ennio Morricone) which accompanies the gals create a sense of tension and dread that will come to tragic fruition.THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS earned universal acclaim upon its release, winning the Golden Bear at the Venice Film Festival. Unsurprisingly, the only nation not to sing its praises was France, who were not ready to have their wounds reopened so soon after granting independence. Particular irritated were far-right groups with ties to the OAS and other paramilitary types. Jean-Marie LePen remains a fierce critic of THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, which only reinforces the conviction that Pontocorvo's depiction was 100% correct.Paradoxically provocative and neutral, the impact of THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS continues to be far-reaching. The Black Panthers, the I. R. A., and P. L. O. All allegedly copied some of the guerilla tactics portrayed in the picture. Among Pontocorvo's peers in the director's chair, Stanley Kubrick, Werner Herzog, Costa Gavros, and Ken Loach were huge admirers. Contemporary filmmakers Spike Lee, Oliver Stone, and Steven Soderbergh appear on DVD supplements to explain how much THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS influenced their various particular styles.

                "What everyone forgets nowadays is that the French contribution to counter insurgency warfare was \" The ink spot strategy \" which was very effective against the Viet Minh in the early stages of the French Indo-China conflict 1946-54 . The same strategy was used most effectively by the British in Malaya in the 1950s where it crushed a communist insurrection , though it was painfully ineffective when the Brits used it in Afghanistan 50 years later . We can all remember the hurtful comments about France being shouted from The White House during Dubya's era but didn't stop the irony - if not out and out hypocrisy - of the same politicians watching this film in order to pick up a few tips on counter insurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan Before tonight I saw this almost 20 years ago and have never forgotten it . What I remembered most was the very even handed dealt out to both sides . This doesn't mean it tries either side as light gray , more like very very dark gray which neither side should be proud of . Based on the grim realities of the time . The French are happy to carry out black ops against the rebellion by blowing up innocent Algerian citizens making out houses are used for bomb factories and brutally torturing interned suspects while the Algerian rebels ( FLN ) blow up innocent civilians at coffee bars and sports stadiums , their victims not being the French military but innocent men woman and children . There are moments that can only be described as surreal irony where for example an Algerian child is stopped from being beaten to death by a French gendarme This is a political film that shows a neutral point of view . In this type of conflict nearly everyone is neutral . Both the French and FLN try and make a headway in to turning the neutral in to being on \" Our side \". Watching it in 2012 however you must be aware of one thing: The FLN are Muslims but they don't want to make a liberated Algeria in to a theocratic Islamic state - they're ( Relatively secular ) nationalists fighting again French colonialism . They're offering the Algerian people freedom from France not freedom from freedom . There's a subtlety to the ideas being put forward by both sides . The French realise not everyone is a terrorist whilst the FLN realise not everything can be solved by violence - revolutions need the will of the people . I could spend all day discussing the complex views put forward but there's a word limit of 1000 words . Just watch it and understand it There's some obvious flaws to the movie . One is that many of the deaths are a bit too bloodless . Another is that we never see what is happening outside of the Algerian capital though the war in the countryside is referred to . Perhaps the biggest complaint is that two years after the main action the story jumps forward where more violent demonstrations take place without the benefit of historical context but if you understand revolution it's because the occupying power hasn't provided any political gains to the wider Algerian population after temporarily beating the FLN . All insurrections are political in nature and if politicians can't bring a political carrot to the table after beating the insurrection to death with a stick then the violence will continue periodically and ultimately end in defeat . I do hope all politicians in charge of a NATO country realise this",

                "The problem with films like The Battle of Algiers is that while they offer a stark portrait of a true-life event, they also lack any kind of emotion and so connecting with the film is not easy. The film follows the events of the revolution in Algiers, but doesn't give you much of a story as to why it happened and so prior knowledge of the event is required from the viewer. I know practically nothing about Algiers, so this wasn't a very good aspect of the movie for me; and through it's lack of emotional connection; I can't help but think I'd have been better off watching the news or a documentary on the subject. The Battle of Algiers is unpleasant throughout, and we watch as coffee shops are blown up and the French Foreign Legion tortures the locals. Like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this film begs a question of it's viewer - namely, why are you watching this? However, while Henry had the whole 'slasher' craze on it's side to help answer the question - the events in this film are far more brutal than those in Henry, and are also on a far larger scale. Not to mention far more tragic, as they definitely did actually happen. Couple this with it's lack of an emotional side; and we have the question; indeed, why ARE you watching this? It's not entertainment, that's for sure.The cinematography is very bleak and offers a stark portrayal of the events that the film is depicting. This is the film's major strong point - it looks very nice. None of the cast stands out individually, but the ensemble comes together nicely and the acting is extremely realistic, so much so that what is being depicted could easily be documentary footage. The main backbone of the film's substance focuses on the common 'war has no winners' theme that a hundred films have depicted before and after it; except even this is brought down by it's emotional void. While films such as Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front gave you characters to feel for; The Battle of Algiers has none and even though it's message is still felt, it's not as potent as it could, and by rights should, have been. Due to the current state of the world, most notably the current mood in the USA, The Battle of Algiers can easily be used as a benchmark to draw parallels with nowadays, which in a way has given it a new lease of life in today's society. On the whole, I respect this movie for it's technical achievement and the fact that it offers an unbiased account of an important event in history. But I don't like it.",

                "The movie takes place during the Algerian independence from France. The director spent a good amount of time depicting the violence in the city of Algiers between both the French military and the Algerian National Liberation Army. It shows the tactics and strategies that both sides use to achieve their goal. Each one commits atrocities to each other. After Algerians kill random people in the street, the French retaliate by throwing bombs into random's Algerian's houses and vice versa. The violence just keeps escalating. Given that the city is neatly divided between both Algerian and French, both organizations can easily attack the other side by going to their enemy's neighborhood and randomly attacking them.I was impressed by how soon to the events the movie was made - just a few years after Algeria was independent and the war ended so that made it much more relevant. This movie is something that should be watched by military and foreign policymakers. It shows that you can win a battle but not necessarily the war. This movie is in black and white and plays like a documentary. There is no sugarcoating. The dialogue can be pretty intense, and the hate between protagonists is on full display. Some of the scenes are disturbing as well. There are some moments that just feel the same as events that happened in the last few years. The movie feels new and yet it was made almost 50 years ago. I think it was so raw, and focused on the fight that I wished the director could have explored the characters more.",

But the unprotected aristocrat has already caught the attention of Count Fujiwara, a duplicitous man with a foolproof plan to get his hands on the lady&#39;s inheritance. As a result, the unscrupulous lord hires a dexterous young pickpocket to act as the new housekeeper.

        "synopsis": "PART ONE\nSet in Korea during the 1930s prior to World War II, the film begins with a local Korean woman named Sook-Hee preparing to move away from her home and move into the estate of a Japanese heiress, Lady Hideko. Sook-Hee is taken on a long ride until she reaches the large estate in the countryside. A woman greets her and gives her a tour of the grounds including an annex which has been furnished into a library. Sook-Hee is told that she wont sleep in the servants quarters but near the Lady of the house as she is her handmaiden. She calls Sook-Hee 'Tamako' and tells her that the lady is often tasked with reading for the master (her uncle) and that he loves books. Sook-Hee is then showed her room which is just across from the Lady's bedroom. When left alone, Sook-Hee tries to peek into the room but a loud noise scares her back to her tiny cot.\nLater in the night, Sook-Hee awakens to hear the Lady Hideko screaming. She rushes into her bedroom and comforts her. Hideko says she had a nightmare and tells Sook-Hee that her aunt had hung herself from the big cherry tree and on moonless nights, her aunts ghost dangles from the branch. Sook-Hee proves to be a good handmaiden as she comforts the Lady by feeding her sake and singing to her.\nSook-Hee tells us (through voice-over) that we think she is a Korean handmaiden named Tamako but she's really Sook-Hee, a pickpocket raised by a woman who teaches children how to steal and commit forgeries. In a flashback, we see the house takes in abandoned newborns and sells them to Japan. A man enters the house of thieves and tells them about an interpreter who bribed his way into a translating job for the high officials. He helps Japan annex Korea and then gets naturalized so he can marry the daughter of a Japanese noble. He builds a mansion, filled with books, and invites Japanese collectors to his library to hold readings of rare books and auction them off. Some of the books, he needs to sell but doesn't want to lose possession so he hired this man (telling the story) to create forgeries he has convinced the nobles he is Count Fujiwara from Japan. The collector's wife died with no children and her sister has died but his wife's niece is still alive and employed to perform book readings for her uncle. Now an orphan, this woman is rich she has 1.5 million yen in cash and 300,000 yen in bonds -- and the man who calls himself Count Fujiwara plans to make her fall in love with him and after marrying her, hell declare her insane and have her locked up in a madhouse thus inheriting her fortune. He wants Sook-Hee to work as her handmaiden so she can persuade her to fall in love. Her uncle also wants to marry her for her money but if Sook-Hee can convince her to marry the Count, hell give her 50,000 yen and the dresses and jewelry. Sook-Hee demands 100,000 yen.\nSook-Hee goes to the estate to meet with the staff, to convince them to hire her. The women who work on staff steal her shoes as a prank which angers her because it will make her look bad. She is amazed to see how beautiful Lady Hideko is. Sook-Hee gives her a reference letter from the last woman she worked for but in reality, its a forgery by the man who is pretending to be Count Fujiwara. He has written it in Japanese, which Sook-Hee can't read or write. He has told Sook-Hee what the letter says \"A maid is like a pair of chopsticks\". Her presence is little noted, but her absence causes much distress. Lady Hideko claims she has a headache from all the reading she has had to do for her uncle and asks Sook-Hee to read it. Sook-Hee struggles to do so from memory, claiming it says she's like a spoon and then finally admits she is illiterate and can't even read in Korean. Lady Hideko said she doesn't care if Sook-Hee curses or steals but she doesn't ever want to be lied to. She shows Sook-Hee a picture of her mother and asks if she is as beautiful. Sook-Hee tells her that she has heard the Count say he dreams of her face in bed, her first attempt at planting a seed of a relationship.\nLady Hideko gives Sook-Hee some shoes and then leaves to go to reading practice, which shell do alone. Sook-Hee goes through all the dresses to see what clothes shell inherit after the woman is locked up. She finds Ben Wa balls. After trying on hats, she finds a rope in a hatbox. Sook-Hee goes outside and looks up at the cherry tree the Lady's aunt was said to have hung herself from.\nSook-Hee finds Lady Hideko reading in the library with her uncle. She tries to approach but is told not to go past the snake. A gate is rolled closed, locking her out. She notices a statue of a snake on the ground, creating a boundary of limitations which she isn't allowed to cross.\nBack in her room, Sook-Hee bathes Lady Hideko, giving her a lollipop which she says she used on children to help them associate bath time with sweetness. Lady Hideko complains one of her teeth is sharp. Sook-Hee grabs a thimble and begins shaving it down. The two exchange sexual energy while this is going on. Sook-Hee admires Lady Hideko's naked breasts.\nCount Fujiwara arrives at the estate to help with forgeries and requests the Lady's handmaiden to run an errand for him. Sook-Hee and the Count discuss their plan in private. Sook-Hee tells him the Lady is na\u00efve and wont take the hint that he wants sex, even if he pulls on her nipples. Count Fujiwara says Sook-Hee has to put it into her head that the Lady is much happier since he arrived. He also gives her a gift to send along. Sook-Hee presents the gift sapphire earrings. Sook-Hee is excited that they'll be hers when the Lady is sent away to the madhouse. She also convinces Lady Hideko that the earrings are actually spinel.\nLady Hideko arranges for Sook-Hee to be dressed up which is a new experience for Sook-Hee. Lady Hideko finishes off the look with the sapphire earrings. They button each others dresses up which is depicted in a very sexual way with Sook-Hee openly longing to touch her. Sook-Hee asks if Lady Hideko is planning to marry her uncle. Hideko points out that's what he raised her for, knowing he'd need access to her money one day. Eventually he will put his entire library up for auction because he cant afford any more books.\nThe Count paints with Lady Hideko, trying to be flirtatious. Sook-Hee watches, feeling sorry for Lady Hideko for being duped. He tells Sook-Hee a peach is ripe which is the signal for her to start convincing the Lady that shes falling in love with the Count. After he leaves, Sook-Hee claims the Lady's cheeks have grown flushed since he arrived but the Lady isn't really convinced.\nLady Hideko and Sook-Hee have a personal conversation on the grounds, about how the Lady's mother died in childbirth and its like she strangled her as punishment for being born. Sook-Hee takes this to heart and tells her no baby is guilty of being born and that her mother would probably have been very happy to have given life to her. This surprises and touches the Lady. The Count arrives and steals the Lady away, sending Sook-Hee to run errands so they can be alone. Not wanting to leave Lady Hideko with the Count, Sook-Hee rushes to grab things but when she returns, she sees the clothed Lady mounting the clothed Count, which makes her terribly jealous.\nNow Sook-Hee harbors anger at Lady Hideko. At night, the servants bell is rang and Sook-Hee is called into the Lady's bedroom. She asks Sook-Hee why she didn't greet her when she got back from her reading. Sook-Hee is obviously still bitter that Lady Hideko is falling for the Count but claims she simply fell asleep. The Lady says she can feel a nightmare coming on and suggests Sook-Hee sleep in bed with her. After a while, she tells Sook-Hee that the count asked to elope with her when her uncle leaves to visit his gold mine. The Lady says without a mother, shes never been told what men want. Sook-Hee teaches her how to kiss by demonstrating on her. Then she begins to make love to her under the context of showing her what it will be like when she makes love to the Count. The two women end up having sex for the first time, both claiming it is simply an instruction although they both seem to be in love with the other.\nThe next time the Count is painting with Lady Hideko, he orders Sook-Hee to find another job to do. Sook-Hee follows suit but then stops short, saying she has no other job except to look after the Lady. Outside the grounds, the Count yells at Sook-Hee for not helping him with his plan. He puts Sook-Hees hands on his crotch and tells her to feel how much he wants her fortune and tells her hes not going to let her fuck it up. Sook-Hee threatens to tell her that hes just a pickpocket but he threatens, in return, to tell her that Sook-Hee is a Korean farmhand and shaman. Sook-Hee cant return home empty-handed, not providing for all the people who have taken her in since she was a little girl. Sook-Hee responds by saying Lady Hideko has no one on earth and if he frightens her, shell close up like a clam. She adds not to ever put her hand on his tiny joke of a cock again.\nNow Sook-Hee follows the plan accordingly, telling Lady Hideko that she (the Lady) is falling for the Count. But the Lady says she's fallen in love with somebody else. Nonetheless, Lady Hideko agrees to marry the Count if Sook-Hee can go with them to Japan. The Count leaves the estate to visit his mine while the Count pretends to leave but secretly hides so he can sneak off with Lady Hideko. As soon as her uncle is gone, Hideko leaves with the Count and Sook-Hee on a ferry to Japan. Once there, Hideko and the Count are married. The next morning, Sook-Hee stops by their room and finds blood on Hideko's sheets, alluding to having lost her virginity. The Count watches the two women together. When he's not looking, Sook-Hee kisses Hideko.\nBy the end of the week, Count Fujiwara is missing, claiming that he has gone to certify the marriage and convert the inheritance into cash. When he returns, Sook-Hee yells at him for taking her virginity and then leaving her alone. She tells him to hurry up and throw Hideko in the madhouse. Two men arrive at the hotel and ask Sook-Hee what treatment she would suggest for Hideko. Sook-Hee says she wants her confined to a place where no one can harm her and she can do no harm. The group travels into town, stopping at a mental hospital. Sook-Hee waits with the employees as they tell the Countess they are going to look after her but then they end up grabbing Sook-Hee and taking her into the madhouse. She claims she is not the Countess and they have the wrong woman. The Count and Hideko do nothing to defend Sook-Hee as she struggles.\nPART TWO\nWe now learn about the back story of Lady Hideko. As a little girl, she has to put medal balls in her mouth (reminiscent of Ben Wa balls) while she is hit repeatedly by her handmaiden for talking back. She is then brought into her room where she's told there is an ogre who lives outside her room who will burst in and smother her if she ever cries out. The aunt also shares the photo of Hideko's mother that we had seen her show to Sook-Hee.\nHideko's aunt instructs her in Japanese by reading books which end up being graphic and teaching her words like penis and vagina. Her uncle comes by and grabs both of their faces, suffocating them before letting them go. We now see the young Hideko slapping a servant for saying bad things about her in Korean, which she can speak. Her uncle tells her that she has a touch of lunacy that she got from her mother and he will try to teach her so she doesn't get sent to a mental hospital. The training consists of her being taught to read from his book collection which is now revealed to be very explicitly sexual books. The young Hideko reads from a graphic story and her uncle yells at her lack of articulation. We then see the adult Lady Hideko at the readings for collectors, reading from sexually explicit passages.\nShe flashes back to the day of her aunt's hanging and the servants staring up at her. Meanwhile, the readings continue for the Japanese book collectors and the stories are more and more graphic. She also performs demonstrations of the material for the audience she chokes herself; she is whipped; she sits on a wooden puppet and is lifted to the ceiling. The books are auctioned off. One has lost its value because the sexually explicit illustration has been ripped out. Nobody wants to buy the book, figuring that the illustration was necessary to depict what words alone could not.\nThe man who pretends to be Count Fujiwara is involved in these readings, hired for forgeries. He tells Hideko's uncle how all the women on the estate are attracted to him except for one Hideko. He heard that her uncle is engaged to her and suggests to him to go easy on her training or shell be dead inside.\nCount Fujiwara and Lady Hideko talk over dinner. He tries to tell her he loves her but she knows he's lying. He admits to being the son of a Korean farmhand and he spent three years learning to paint forgeries so he would have access to her and possess her father's inheritance. But he realized how smart she was after he met her and has another deal to suggest hell rescue her from her uncle, they'll split the money. She says she doesn't want to marry anyone. He realizes she plans to kill herself but he says all her money would go to a perverted uncle. She points out that he will find them if they eloped and take her to the basement where he tortures people he has brought her there as a young girl and showed her what he did to her aunt. Count Fujiwara gives her highly concentrated opium and says if she's ever caught, three drops will make her sleep, five drops will knock her out, and all of it will kill her.\nThey plan to find a handmaiden for her who they will send to a madhouse under Hideko's name. They get rid of her old one after she is caught having sex with the Count. We now see Sook-Hee's arrival from Hideko's perspective. When Sook-Hee tries to peek in her room, she bangs against the wall, scaring her. She watches Sook-Hee undress for bed. Then she screams to get Sook-Hee to come, claiming she had a nightmare. Hideko reads a letter from Count Fujiwara telling her to show Sook-Hee her clothes at every opportunity since that is part of what she will receive for helping him out (if she wasn't being duped). He points out she wont be able to read the letter she's reading because she's illiterate. Hence her asking Sook-Hee to read the recommendation out loud she knew she couldn't read it. Hideko also goes outside and scolds her servants for stealing Sook-Hee's shoe, saying if she runs away, shell throw them out. In the next flashback, we see Sook-Hee bathing Hideko and fixing her tooth but now we see this was followed by Hideko inviting Sook-Hee to join her in the tub.\nWhen Sook-Hee presents the earrings to Hideko, Count Fujiwara wrote her a letter warning her that Sook-Hee would pretend they were fake because she wants them but they're actually Hideko's own earrings. He tells her, to keep her from getting suspicious, they should occupy Sook-Hee with the task of trying to convince Hideko to marry him and that she shouldn't fall in love with him too easily. As before, Hideko gives Sook-Hee the earrings and admires her when she is dressed up. Also as before, Sook-Hee is very kind towards Hideko when she discusses losing her mother in childbirth, leading Hideko to feel a companionship towards Sook-Hee.\nCount Fujiwara and Hideko really don't like each other and both only tolerate the other to go along with their plan. Sook-Hee now mopes around, angry, watching a flirtatious exchange between Hideko and the Count; now we hear them openly discussing their dislike for each other. Sook-Hee becomes jealous which Hideko notices. As before, when she is away running errands, Sook-Hee rushes back to find a clothed Hideko mounting Count Fujiwara on the grounds. Now we see that they staged that pose just to convince her they were falling in love.\nWe see Hideko giving the readings of sexual literature to the Japanese men. She reads about Ben Wa balls. The men applaud.\nNext, we see the scene again where Hideko and Sook-Hee have sex, under the pretext of educating Hideko on how to please a man. But now the lesbian sex scene is extended and more graphic, showing both women taking turns orally pleasuring each other (cunnilingus) as well as fingering as well as grinding. Sook-Hee tells Hideko that she is a natural with performing the sex.\nA day or two later, Count Fujiwara yells at Lady Hideko, telling her if she scares Sook-Hee, shell close up like a clam. The Lady feels bad about arranging to have Sook-Hee locked up in a madhouse but he tells her that Sook-Hee said Lady Hideko was so dense, she wouldn't know someone wanted sex even if they pulled on her nipples. While it is true Sook-Hee said this early on, it was when she was not fully invested in Lady Hideko's companionship and trying hard to go along with the plan despite her developed attachment. However, it is enough to upset Lady Hideko who is now convinced Sook-Hee doesn't really have feelings for her. In her room, Hideko asks Sook-Hee if she still thinks she should marry the Count, even if she (the Lady) ends up having feelings for someone else. When Sook-Hee says yes, Hideko slaps her and shoves her out of her room. Then she grabs the rope that Sook-Hee found in the hatbox earlier and goes to hang herself from the same tree her aunt had, saying she wishes she'd never been born. (We're meant to believe this is why she allows Sook-Hee to be sent to a madhouse despite falling in love with her).\nBut when hanging from the tree, before she can fall, Sook-Hee appears, holding Hideko by the legs. She immediately confesses to everything, how she was trying to trick her into marrying the Count and they were going to send her to the madhouse. Hideko asks, Sook-Hee, are you worried about me? and Sook-Hee asks how she knows her name since shes pretended to be a handmaiden named Tamako. Hideko confesses her plan to send Sook-Hee to the madhouse. Now Sook-Hee writes home and tells the woman who raised her to be a thief there is a change of plans and they need her help with a forgery.\nHideko's uncle drives away to visit his gold mines. He warns Lady Hideko about the basement, meaning if she ever betrays him, he will punish her with torture like he has done to family members before. With him gone, Sook-Hee is finally able to explore the library. She sees the uncle's collection is all perversely sexual literature. Offended that Hideko had been forced to read it, she tears pages and illustrations out of all the books and then dumps them in the indoor ponds underneath the floorboards.\nThe two women are finally free, preparing for Hideko to elope, and we see them running through the fields, laughing. Cut to Sook-Hee being put in the madhouse. Instead of sadness, Hideko is seemingly unaffected and says she's hungry.\nPART THREE.\nHideko and Count Fujiwara dine at a nice restaurant, their plan having worked. Meanwhile, Sook-Hee laughs hysterically while eating dinner at the mental hospital. At a photography studio, Count Fujiwara explains that they'll replace Sook-Hee's photo on her ID with Hideko's so she can take on her identity and Hideko can be declared in a mental institution, allowing them to recoup her inheritance without being caught by her uncle. The Count confesses he might actually like Hideko and suggests they get married again, now that shes stolen Sook-Hee's identity. She inquires whether he feels remorse about having locked Sook-Hee in a madhouse alone but he says she's na\u00efve and deserves her fate.\nIn the madhouse, a fire is set allowing Sook-Hee to escape.\nBack at a hotel, Hideko dips the opium the Count gave her into a wine glass. They kiss and he decides he wants to have sex. She drinks from her wine glass, hoping hell follow suit, but he doesn't. She lets him kiss her breasts and then they kiss but he still doesn't drink the wine. Finally she drinks from his glass and kisses him, transferring wine from her mouth to his. He then gets really aggressive towards her sexually, citing the books she read out loud that declares women like being taken forcefully. But before he can harm her, he passes out from the opium in the wine.\nWhen he wakes up, he is being taken by two thugs somewhere into town.\nNow Sook-Hee and Hideko have reunited. Sook-Hee has taken a picture of herself dressed as a man and uses her forgery skills to replace the photo in Count Fujiwara's ID, taking over his identity. Hideko sends a letter to her uncle, telling him that the Japanese Count who he had been trying to impress for years is actually the son of a Korean farmhand and she drops him off with her uncle as a gift. She also tells him to tell the Count that, outside of books, no woman likes to be taken by force. Now that he knows he's been betrayed, the uncle takes the man who pretended to be Count Fujiwara to his basement and tortures him, cutting off his fingers with a paper trimmer. The Count asks for a cigarette.\nThe two women go to the train station. The uncle's goons are there, checking for any women traveling together who are trying to leave town. The women go undetected in two ways; they buy a ticket to a nearby city and then change it to Shanghai, paying the difference; and Hideko is currently disguised as a man so they aren't seen as two women.\nIn another flashback, we see that the Count didn't really take Hideko's virginity. She broke her own hymen with a butter knife, resulting in the blood Sook-Hee saw the next morning. In present day, Hideko's uncle asks about all the details about his niece's wedding night, exposing that he had a perverted fascination with his young niece and wasn't simply after her money. He asks graphic questions about whether he touched her breasts or her vagina. Whether her vagina had many wrinkles and the look of her vaginal secretion. He admits he's just an old man who likes dirty stories. The Count ignores him, asking for a cigarette to help his memory, which Hideko's uncle grabs from the Count's clothes and he smokes.\nThe two women have made it to the ferry. Hideko gets rid of her fake mustache now that they're safely en route to Shanghai. Meanwhile, Hideko's uncle cuts off the Count's underwear as he lays bleeding from losing his fingers. Before the torture can continue, the Count says that the cigarettes were filled with mercury and they both are now poisoned from the smoke. The uncle dies. The Count inhales the air in an effort to kill himself.\nIn the final scene, Sook-Hee and Hideko are in their stateroom on the ship as they travel to their new home. Now free, they undress and kiss and have a long sexual experience (they have more lesbian sex; but this time they are both clearly affectionate and in love). They put the Ben Wa balls in their mouths and then inside each others vaginas. The final shot shows the steamer ship sailing away into the night.",

                "I knew nothing about this film coming into it, other that it being very well considered, and that it has some strong sexual content. This is probably the best way to watch it, as I did not know where the plot was going to start or go. Essentially a con man plans to seduce, marry, and abandon a wealthy unmarried woman \u2013 taking her from her uncle and then taking her money. To do this he employs the services of a young pickpocket to work as her handmaiden, and help work the plan from the inside, so to speak.What the film does with this basic plot is enjoyable and engaging. The narrative is solid, holds the interest without effort, and is very well paced and structured. I wonder would it work as well if I had known the source material, or had more knowledge of the wider plot. As a con, the plot is solidly enjoyable and avoids the silly flamboyance of some films where such a plot would be allowed to turn into a 'caper'. Within the plot are some surprisingly sexual elements, and these sit across the sweet, the sensual, and the dark. There is also a good amount of humor where it matters \u2013 in particular in part 1 of the film, this is used well in relation to the main character.The direction, production values, and general pacing of the film, all work together to give it a beautiful appearance and tone. It is quite sensuous to watch, with such great colors, sets, costumes, and designs. Within this the actors are all strong. Min-hee Kim and Tae- ri Kim in particular are engaging, although the downside of me being into their characters/performances was that it made the heavy nudity in some of their extended scenes feel a bit exploitative in nature. Jung-woo Ha is solid throughout, and Jin-woong Jo is just the right level of monster for the plot to work.A richly enjoyable film, that sits across so many elements and looks so good that it keeps the plot engaging throughout.",

                "This is hands down the most perfect film I have seen so far this year. I gave a score of 5/5 to movies like The Revenant, Spotlight and The Songs We Sang. But even with these excellent films I can always find a spot that doesn't quite sit right with me. With The Handmaiden, it is perfect; every frame handcrafted to perfection. Even with 4min of explicit sex taken away by my country's dumb censors, this is still perfect every way I see it.Auteur Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is a superb exercise in form, structure and tone. With the latter, Park (Oldboy & Joint Security Area) has achieved something extraordinary. If any scene were to linger a few seconds longer or he had decided to focus on a certain issue, the film would have veered off to a different territory. As it is, and with all the major characters' kooky off-kilter portrayals, I can't pinpoint whether I was watching something real or abstract. I was also kept in awe by the intricate and resplendent set- design which suggests something dark and Gothic is working the undercurrents. There are of course some serious girl on girl action but that never encroaches into the spine of the story.Adapting Sarah Waters' Fingersmith, a Victorian tale awash with all manner of Dickensian motifs, Park spins an engrossing tale that ebbs and flows with a Hitchcockian suspense; it withholds as much as it discloses; it is an erotic tale that beats with raw fervour. It is at once a love story but also a menagerie showcasing human beings in their vilest forms. Park's finger hovers over all the buttons, teasing us gleefully but it is with the ultimate restraint that he never descends down to the usual tropes. The story is divided into three chapters; each told from a different character's perspective. The structure is Rashomon-esque but Park puts his own stamp on it. The film may be nearly 2.5 hours but I hardly moved in my seat; my senses kept spellbound as each twist hits me hard. When it ended I couldn't believe 2.5 hours have whizzed by. The plot is pulsating and it never lets up. There is even an octopus in it! This is definitely the most perfect film I have seen this year.

                "\"The Handmaiden\" is a crazily imaginative and beautiful movie by Chan-wook Park, who is at the top of his game in this story of a pickpocket that tries to steal the fortune of a naive, innocent rich woman that has been secluded in a mansion in the middle of nowhere. Of course, things will start to get complicated soon enough.Chan-wook Park has done a great job in adapting the original novel by Sarah Waters, and mixing it with the history of the Japanese invasion of Korea at the beginning of the twentieth century. The plot is a little bit silly sometimes, but Chan-wook Park makes it all tight and fast-paced, and even the most silly moment becomes a moment of beauty and fun. From the first moment, the viewer will be enthralled by the story of these two women and their relationship, and every plot development will just add fun to the whole.If the plot and the direction weren't amazing enough, the movie is as beautiful as they come. From the darkest moment, the most violent, to the most intimate, beauty transpires in every frame, and every scene comes to life and threatens to pop and break free from the screen. This is helped by the amazing work of all the cast, who does an incredible job in bringing this tale to life (it could be criticized, though, some of the heavily accented Japanese, for characters that are supposed to be able to pass as them).All in all, \"The Handmaiden\" is proof that a movie can have a plot, amazing direction, acting, scenery, craziness and the most beautiful package possible. And even if it is almost two hours and a half long, it feels like a breeze.You will fall in love with this movie. Just plain great.",

Hideko is supported by her Uncle Kouzuki (Jin-woong Jo) and the gold-digger \"Count Fujiwara\" (Jung-woo Ha), who is indeed son of peasants, wants to marry her to steal her inheritance. Sook-Hee is a small-time thief of the ring of the conman \"Count Fujiwara\" and is sent to help him in the confidence game. But soon Hideko and Sook- Hee get close to each other and become lovers. But Sook-Hee is pressed by Fujiwara to betray her friend. When Fujiwara marries Hideko, they go with Sook-Hee to an asylum and the nurses hold Sook- Hee believing that she is Hideko. Why Hideko poses of servant and leaves Sook-Hee in the asylum to stay with Count Fujiwara?\"Ah-ga-ssi\", a.k.a. \"The Handmaiden\", is a classy South Korean erotic thriller divided in three parts and directed by Chan-wook Park. The first part is slow paced and shows the development of the relationship among Sook-Hee, Lady Hideko and \"Count Fujiwara\". The second part shows the abusive relationship of Uncle Kouzuki and Hideko since her childhood. The third part has many twists and shows the fate of each leader character.

                "The Handmaiden is a film that unfolds with a classic film stylist (in particular I felt like Chanwook Park was in a kind of Brian De Palma mode as far as making an erotic dramatic-thriller with a camera that luxuriates in long shots, elaborate camera movements, and cinematic grammar that emphasizes operatic intentions, though it's maybe not the first time he's done this anyway), and is LOADED with story. What appears to be the story of a handmaiden who is put in as part of a long con by a man who wants to steal this wealthy woman's money is actually a story about storytelling, about weaving a pack of lies and an entire personality and, in reality, how that can start to crack apart when it comes to seeing humanity in another person and their vulnerabilities.There's a lot going on in this movie, and there is a lot that is... sordid and over the top in its sexuality. That's intentional, I'm sure, and Park never coddles his audience with what he's showing as far as sexuality; the two main women of the film, the handmaiden and her master/mistress or what have you, end up having an emotional connection and this leads to a sexual one. This has the most graphic lesbian sexuality on screen since Blue is the Warmest Color, but here the rawness is matched by the elegance of Park's direction, and while you get to see much of it, only some of it (but there *is* some) that is gratuitous. Otherwise, this is a story of backstabbing and betrayal, but all of it leading up to being in the larger sense about how people fit in to the circumstances they are in, how they have to not simply play but BECOME the characters they're playing - and how these images flip based on perceptions and how we see the scenes.Here's where I may become less articulate in my criticism: the film is in three parts, and I forgot about there being 'parts' as I was so into the film during its first part. There is a major betrayal, but then the movie goes into a 'Part 2', and it turns into a different story... a VERY different kind of story, and it is one that left me confused at first, left adrift, and only Park's direction kept me afloat. As Part 2 went on I got into the movie more, though you have to be prepared for scenes from part 1 being repeated - and whether this becomes tedious will vary depending on the viewer. Nothing is ever not gorgeous to look at, and Park is inspired by paintings and art in the real world, and it's completely sumptuous (I'd be rooting for this to win all the costume/production design awards come February), but there comes a point where the filmmakers are showing the 'here's what happened this scene' moments a little too much. I won't reveal why this is done except to say that the characters take on other roles we didn't expect, and their decisions and how they hide parts of their personalities makes for fascinating viewing. Some times.And then it gets to part 3, and the movie goes into being sordid melodrama and not much more. By this time, the filmmakers have to wrap the story up, and show what this man who has been trying to machinate everything for his own ends is met with a nasty fate. Overall there's so much about The Handmaiden to admire, from the performances by Min-hee Kim as Lady Hideko (appearing in part 1 as varieties of cold and distant and then close and warm and terrified in the other parts), Tae-ri Kim (Sookie, who has much to learn about the art of performance, I mean her character not the actress, she's great), and Jung-woo Ha as the 'Count' who has to remain in control for the whole runtime, but gives in to his passions too. And yet I also wonder if a first viewing trying to explain everything how I felt doesn't do the film justice: it moves slower and more languidly than other Park films, so it took longer to get in to, and the themes of conning and performance may be done stronger in any given Quentin Tarantino film (though here done with more taste and intense sexuality - i.e. the scene with the thimball on the tooth).Another viewing may give more, or less. I can tell you now it's worth seeing if you love pure CINEMA, the likes of which get made by directors with a passion for the form and expressing stories of early 20th century sexual excess and emotional f***ed-up ness (it is early 20th century Korea with a major Japanese influence - in that way it'd make a solid double feature with Kim Jee-Woon's Age of Shadows).

                "I consider Park Chan-Wook to be among the greats of cinema, alongside Scorsese, Tarantino, Fellini, Truffaut, Coppola, Tarkovsky and Nolan. So I had huge expectations going in, and boy, they were met.TheHandmaiden is a masterpiece in pretty much every sense. It is visually exquisite, Costumes, production design, cinematography, music, all combine to create a lush vision of Japan-occupied Korea in the 1930s. Park Chan-Wook is a visually meticulous filmmaker and no film so far of his has showcased his knack for visual storytelling better than the Handmaiden. I went into this film totally blind, which I honestly recommend all people doing, because the plot itself unfolds in such a beautifully engineered fashion.My best description of the film is a Rebecca-like Hitchcockian thriller with the extremity and depravity of films like Oldboy and Battle Royale, and the humanistic sexuality of Blue is the Warmest Colour. All actors are stunning in this film. The two women share an honest, tender romance that is both passionate and moving, with a refreshing candour about the nature of sexuality that is almost never seen in Hollywood productions. The Count is an incredibly charismatic performer who remains appealing despite his many despicable acts.But as always with a Park Chan-Wook film, the real star is the director himself. The way in which this story is crafted is nothing short of engrossing. The outrageous, depraved, sexy, fascinating plot is crafted through multiple perspectives, dashing across back and forth in time, to masterfully reveal key plot points across a never less than spellbinding two hour run time. Some would say the film is slow, but I felt as though the extended running time worked in the film's favour, in order to build character to the extent that the finale for the film feels momentously epic, a real feat considering the movie showcases only four key characters.I was utterly engrossed by this beautifully made film.",

It's certainly visually and thematically rich and provocative as it slides between frequently explicit romance, comedy and horror: if in part it aims to shock, it certainly does so in style. However, I struggled to like any of the characters, all of whom seem as selfish and ruthless as each other, and felt no especial sympathy for the female leads simply because they happen to fall in love/list for each other. The film should perhaps be seen as a paean to desire, in all its oddness and intensity.

                "The Handmaiden is a beautifully told story in a beautifully shot film. Some of it's chosen exterior locations are so captivating and mesmerizing, you almost feel you're there, or wish you were. The actresses are beautiful and perform nothing short of excellent, the young girl (The Handmaiden) especially, such a professionally acted job. You'd expect more so sex scenes, that kind of left me a little downtrodden. The major lesbian one, amidst only a couple of others, in this near two and half hour piece, is one of the hottest and most explicit, I've ever seen, this one again, beautifully shot. The story involves a young girl, a new handmaiden, forced to defraud the wife of the husband, only the young girl falls for the wife, where the story kind of manipulates you, as to where the girl's intentions will lead, where revenge is thrown in too, as we go back in time to an earlier period, involving our young girl, and the wife, where we find ourselves returning to some old scenes, but with added stuff- purpose here. This is one you'd have to watch a couple of times to get the complete picture. Didn't understand the change in color of the subtitles, my only qualm. Acting by all is top notch, and our handmaiden is definitely something to ogle at. A handmaiden who's beautifully made. We too have some violence, and some humorous moments. Hopefully this film will command more attention from moviegoers in Adelaide, as here's one faultless cinematic experience, you should experience, and by no accounts, miss, as it will be your loss. The most impressive thing here though, above everything else here is the filming/photography from obviously a very talented photographer.",

                "When going into a movie by one of your favorite directors, it is easy to set high expectations. Rarely does the film fully meet those expectations, but when it does it is something special. Such is the case with Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden (Mademoiselle). He has crafted an intricately woven tale of love and betrayal that highlights everything he can do so well from heightened sexual tension to gorgeous imagery. The film, which is an adaptation of the novel The Fingersmith, revolves around a woman who is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress. This is the very basic summary to a film that has a lot of depth underneath the surface and requires the audience's attention throughout the film. And as the plot goes on we discover the newly hired handmaiden may have some ulterior motives along with many of the other characters. Nothing is revealed too quickly and the film is split into a three-part structure that slowly pieces things together through flashbacks. It also uses a storytelling device that is typically owned by Tarantino where the same scene is shown from multiple perspectives and each adds a new layer to the story. All of these devices are used to full effect and create surprising twists on par with Park Chan-wook's Oldboy.What is immediately apparent from the start of the film is how well Park Chan-wook's aesthetic fits into the time period. His eye for gorgeous shots and camera angles makes the house in the film look like a work of art. The grounds around the house are also highlighted so well. Wide shots and lingering camera movements let you appreciate every little detail on screen and marvel at the beauty of it all. The score also fits in perfectly with the time period. It is never bombastic and always subtle, and perfectly captures the mood and feeling of each scene. Whether an intimate moment between the two women or a heated exchange between characters it's hard to realize how great the score is because of how organic it feels. Framing is also a very important addition to the story. Through the use of mirrors and reflections, Park Chan-wook suggests the double-sided nature of the characters. Also, he often obstructs part of the frame with an object and hides characters behind walls or glass to suggest we may not really see everything that is going on before us. This aspect of the film in particular I feel will only get better with subsequent viewing when you can understand all of characters motivations and desires. One thing that Park Chan-wook did so well with Stoker was creating a palpable feeling of sexual tension without using nudity or anything overtly sexual. In this film he succeeds with that throughout the entire film. Every look and every glance the two woman share conveys a longing and desire that permeates the whole film. In this film however, he continues that passion past suggestion into full on sex. There are multiple scenes with extended nudity but they are all filmed so artfully and sympathetically it always feels warranted. The scenes never feel awkward or exploitative and always are tasteful and almost poetic. Somehow despite what I was watching I still found myself admiring the camera-work and beautiful cinematography. One thing that surprised me in the film and I have not seen in Park Chan-wook's other work is the humor. It was never slapstick and usually more circumstantial, but the whole audience laughed out loud on numerous occasions. He showed a surprisingly great understanding of timing and every joke landed. One scene in particular dealt with suicide and could have come across as insensitive or callous. Due to the perfect timing, it was hilarious and even further developed the relationship between the characters. During the last act of the film, it does get unusually violent. There is a torture scene that seems out of place with the rest of the film. Though effective in its own right and thoroughly thrilling, it didn't sit right with me due to how subtle the rest of the film had been. This is a film that really stays with you and will take multiple viewing to really appreciate the complex story. The first film I have seen in a long time where I continued to think about it throughout the day and had multiple conversations about all aspects of the film. With The Handmaiden, Park Chan-wook has crafted a film that fully displays the craft and technical prowess he can show and it includes a story that that only gets better the more you think about it.The Handmaiden (2016) Directed by: Park Chan-wook Screenplay by: Seo-Kyung Chung, Park Chan-wook Starring: Jung-woo Ha, Min-hee Kim, Jin-woong Jo, Tae Ri Kim Run Time: 2 hour 25 minutes",

                "Not the craziest film content wise, that award goes to The Neon Demon, but definitely the craziest film storytelling wise. Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is almost as good as the film that put him on the map, Oldboy, and brings such ferocity and energy that it will be one of the most unforgettable films of 2016. Think of The Handmaiden as The Duke of Burgundy F'd Up Edition. This film is pretty twisted in the most unexpected ways from the cinematography that is very reminiscent of Possession in that it always keeps moving, eroticism that is reminiscent of Blue is the Warmest Color, performances as spellbinding as Carol, and the insanity of Park Chan- Wook as expected. The cinematography is some of the most entrancing of the year. Shots that look like they came out of The Master. It's shots like these that make me wonder how was this even possible? It looks so damn cool!The performances are perfect in sucking you into this world of erotica, selfishness, and trickery. Both female leads were fantastic. Min-hee Kim and Kim Tae-ri are amazing with sharing their sexual tension with the audience watching. It's films like these that are the most memorable. Making you feel how ther characters are feeling. Jung-woo Ha and Jin- woong Jo were great as these sexually and financially repressed men who do the most screwed up things to feel the pleasure they so desire. Nothing wrong with the cast at all. Of course Park Chank-Wook hits it out of the part with directing. How else would this immaculate vision be done without him niche for detail. He always knows exactly what to do to get an emotion out of his audience and I applaud him for that. The only negative is that during the middle briefly the pacing slows down a lot and it became really unbearable because I wanted to know exactly what was going to happen next. Thankfully it doesn't last that long and it's really minor that probably won't affect others viewings. If you have any interest in The Handmaiden or you've just heard about it for the first time I strongly suggest checking this out as soon as it comes out. I'll definitely re watch it when it releases in theaters. Easily one of the best films of the year and one I hope to re watch soon.",

                "The controversial film from Korean master Chan-wook Park evokes the sexiness of Abdellatif Kechiche's \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" and Park's own signature violence and thrills. Set in the 1930s Japanese occupied Korea, it's a story of a young female pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) who becomes a handmaiden to a beautiful Japanese heiress (Min-hee Kim). However, she must manage to convince the heiress to marry a conman (Jung-woo Ha) who poses as a count, for which she will get a chance for a better life. She gets into a moral dilemma when she starts developing feelings for the heiress.The Handmaiden is a triumph on every level. The film is divided into three chapters, all giving different perspective. This way, the story is perfectly structured to give more and more insight as the film progresses, but at the same time, keep the viewers guessing. It offers a few surprises along the way as well. Visually, it's a feast for the eyes. The term \"every frame a painting\" gets overused, but it really fits here. I'm not only talking about cinematography, which offered plenty of memorable shots and beautiful scenery, but the costume and set design. The three leads all gave terrific performances. Musical score by Yeong-wook evokes, or better said, amplifies the emotions and the suspenseful tone. Despite the run time of 2 hours and 24 minutes, it never gets dull, it's very evenly paced throughout. I couldn't look away for a second.One thing needs to be addressed, the film is quite explicit. That being said, it never gets vulgar, the sex scenes are done in perfect taste, they never feel out of place and they're not there just for the sake of it. The relationship between the characters and the physical presentation of it are integral to the film. It's a film about passion, abuse, jealousy, betrayal and deception, but most of all, it's an atypical love story, which will make one love and hate the protagonists at the same time. It's original and daring work of art that will stick with viewers long after it's finished.Whenever Chan-wook Park makes a film, it must undoubtedly be compared to his masterpiece, \"Oldboy\". I don't think that \"The Handmaiden\" surpasses it, but it comes very close. With this film, he proved himself to be one of the greatest working directors today. It's the best film I've seen this year, one that I can't wait to revisit. It's not to be missed.",

This one relocates a tale of Victorian London to South Korea, where a murky plot involves mucho double-crossing as a con man decides to employ a maid to help him seduce a Japanese heiress due to inherit a fortune.Like the rest of Park Chan-wook's output, this is an expertly-made piece of drama, with sumptuous costumes and filmography, and fine performances from the cast. A pity, then, that it turns out to be merely a romantic drama with a few dark twists. The emphasis is on explicit sex throughout.

I was concerned when this movie is announced, a mis-used sex scene could make the movie feels cheap. This movie did manage to get it quite right.There were scenes of sexual attractions in many parts of the movie but it did not take away all other elements that were done well in the movie.Thematically beautiful, the mansion itself is split half between a western and Japanese. The costume design and cinematography are perfect. The west : grand and luxury; The Japanese : Clean, simple elegant design.The story can be summed up as a hero saving a princess and is split into 3 parts. I loved the first two parts, the third part was the only disappointing part where the plot was predictable and not as interesting and it being the last part makes the movie fell short.The music is perfect. Just like Old Boy, music is more crucial than other movies. Old Boy is a movie that would make you think of a modernized hero revenge movie that is both realistic and unbelievable. The music have strong presence to help build up that world. Same goes with this movie as it is also a very realistic setting (you know the period of time it is based upon, the characters motives are clear and their actions are) yet with some very unbelievable events when you add everything together.It isn't a perfect movie, I saw some editing that could be improved here and there. The last part was also a small disappointment for myself. But it is a damn unique movie that you have to watch.",

The manipulation of colour is done masterfully as well.But other than that I had trouble finding any substance to the film. I enjoyed some scenes, the interaction between actors, but most of them did not feel real so I didn't really take anything from it.There are several slow parts where scenes are replayed from a different perspective and it's mostly interesting for the sexual discovery the characters partake. Actually, there is not much to it other than the sex.It was okay, different from what I usually watch, but I was expecting something more special, especially after watching such an amazing trailer.",

                "In Japanese occupied Korea, Sook-hee is brought in as a maid to Count Fujiwara and as a handmaiden to Lady Hideko. Fujiwara is actually Korean. He intends to marry the Japanese heiress Hideko stealing her family fortune and turning himself into Japanese nobility. Sook-hee is an illiterate simpleton, illiterate both in Japanese and Korean. In reality, she comes from a 'family' of thieves hired by Fujiwara in a scheme to send Hideko into an asylum after marrying her.There is a shocking twist at the end of Part 1 which left me a little confused. One spends the rest of them movie trying to make sense of that turn of event. Honestly, I don't think it answers my questions fully to my satisfaction. I can't accept that it's the best escape plan for anybody. It's a scheme that can't be examined too deeply. It would be more definitive to fake her death. It leaves me feeling a little scammed especially since none of the characters can be believed at face value. They're all lying and I couldn't grab onto the truth. I'd rather they play it straight sending Hideko into the asylum and the Count double-crossing Sook-hee along with everybody else. She could return to rescue Hideko and fall in love. This one does feel a little constructed to shock. Honestly, my only reason to see this is that it's on the top 250 list. It's rare to have a pulpy twisty erotic thriller on the list. This one is beautiful and shot like an art piece. This is a real artistic endeavor from the nude erotica to the complex story construction. It is highly ambitious although I remain unconvinced by the twist.",

                "I watched the longer Directors Cut of the movie and it is something to behold. A very interesting story, that might have intrigued someone like M. Night Shyamalan too (I always have to think if I wrote that correctly - would be nice if imdb had a feature where it recognized names and helped one out). The story and its pace are fairly easy and slow to follow. There is nudity and adult situations (not sure if they are cut in the theatrical release), but that is not something that should be disturbing the viewer at all. If it does, maybe the movie is not something you should watch (or read up on if there is less nudity in the other cut).Having concenterated way too much on that aspect (it is what it is as someone recently said in a way worse context), the movie is well told and may reprise certain moments to give the viewer a fuller picture of what he experienced - which overall is a nice thing, but some may find redundant. Park Chan Wook is more than Old Boy, if you are still stuck on that (great movie no doubt), and he more than proves it here",

I can't recommend this to anyone. The extended graphic sex scenes don't serve the story at all and are just for ratings. How can anyone not see this is beyond me. The story is barely there and predictable after 30 minutes.I think that because there are Korean and Japanese languages spoken, rather well I'm told, that this movie gets a boost. Another boost for nudity and a bit of revenge. It's a 5 at best if you ignore these bonuses.

If you remove the unquestionably excessive scenes, it becomes a thrilling tale of deception and cunning, with dialogue and acting that deeply convinced me the actor's truly felt their characters' emotions. But the continuous bombardment of pornography makes it very clear that director Park had no intentions of making a respectable film. Perhaps his intention was to see if he could persuade critics that an overtly explicit work could somehow be considered art rather than pornography?

This was another amazing film from Park Chan-wook. His films are always brilliant and this was no exception! It was such a beautiful LGBTQ story and I'm happy to have watched it.The cinematography was stunning and artistic, with bleak yet beautiful colour palettes, it was always pleasing to the eye. There was some really good shot transitions and I loved the camera tracking too. Overall, the film was just very well shot!I loved the characters and really felt for them, this was helped by phenomenal acting from everyone involved. The dialogue was sharp and witty too. The two main actresses had amazing on-screen chemistry and their characters felt so different in interesting ways, it was beautiful to see them come together.The music and score were equally as amazing, and only added to the beauty and emotion of the film. Also, the sound mixing was effective and the lack of score nearer the end made it so much more powerful and impactful!The film was paced steadily and slowly, with interesting structure as it's split into parts. The tone is mostly very sensual and beautiful, but the film includes some intense twists and turns that dramatic change the tone at times which I liked, this kept me hooked. It was all super unexpected. In addition, it actually gets quite disturbing and there's a lot to digest (I mean this positively). And overall, I loved how the filmmakers pieced the story together.",

Despite Skeeter&#39;s life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories -- and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. Along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly -- and unwillingly -- caught up in the changing times.",

As Skeeter gradually wins the cooperation of the fearful African-American housekeepers to dish the dirt on the upper-crust southern families, she inevitably locks horns with bigoted community leaders, arrogant childhood friends, and her family.

        "synopsis": "In civil-rights era Jackson, Mississippi, 23-year-old Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (\nEmma Stone\n), a recent graduate of the University of Mississippi and an aspiring writer, attends a bridge game at the home of her friend Elizabeth Leefolt (\nAhna O'Reilly\n). Skeeter's girlhood friends have all gotten married and started families, but Skeeter is disturbed to see how they treat their African American maids.\nElizabeth's maid, Aibileen Clark (\nViola Davis\n), fields a call from \"white trash\" Celia Foote (\nJessica Chastain\n), who wants to help with a benefit being organized by the Junior League. Elizabeth and fellow socialite Hilly Holbrook (\nBryce Dallas Howard\n), head of the local Junior League chapter, laugh at Celia's efforts to be accepted, as they don't think she's up to their social standards. (We learn later that Celia's married to Hilly's former boyfriend, which might have something to do with Hilly's attitude.) Celia mentions to Aibileen that she's looking for a maid. After refusing to use Elizabeth's toilet because Aibileen uses it (\"they carry different diseases than we do!\"), Hilly describes the Home Health Sanitation Initiative she hopes to get passed in the state legislature. The bill would require white-owned homes to have a separate toilet for the Negro \"help.\" This conversation is conducted within earshot of Aibileen.\nSkeeter has been assigned to write the Miss Myrna housekeeping column for the local newspaper. Because she has never had to do much housework herself, she asks Aibileen for assistance. In addition to doing all the cooking and cleaning for Elizabeth's family, Aibileen is the de facto mother of Elizabeth's toddler daughter, Mae Mobley (\nEleanor Henry\nand\nEmma Henry\n), for whom Elizabeth shows heart-rendingly little concern. Every day Aibileen tells Mae Mobley, \"You is kind. You is smart. You is important.\"\nWhen Skeeter gets home, her mother, Charlotte (\nAllison Janney\n), is trying on a dress. Charlotte gets Skeeter to try it on and bugs her about still being single. Skeeter mentions the job she landed, and her mother frets that she'll never get married. Charlotte asks whether Skeeter is attracted to women, as she's \"heard of an herbal remedy than can cure such 'unnatural' urges.\" Skeeter is horrified.\nAt dinner that night Skeeter makes a rude remark about liking girls and her mother excuses herself from the table because Skeeter has upset her cancerous ulcer. Skeeter runs to a favorite spot outdoors, a small bench under a tree, and remembers how Constantine (\nCicely Tyson\n), the maid who raised her from a child, comforted her when she wasn't asked to a dance. Skeeter desperately misses Constantine, who according to Charlotte quit while Skeeter was away at college. Skeeter can tell there's more to the story, but no one will say what really happened. Disturbed by the sudden loss of Constantine and at how Elizabeth and Hilly treat their own maids with bigoted condescension, Skeeter conceives a writing project: a book about the lives of Jackson's maids. She describes the project to Elaine Stein (\nMary Steenburgen\n), an editor in New York, and receives lukewarm encouragement; Elaine doubts that any maids will agree to participate. Skeeter approaches Aibeleen about the book, but Aibileen declines to be interviewed.\nHilly's maid, Minny Jackson (\nOctavia Spencer\n), disobeys Hilly's order not to use the family's bathroom during a violent thunderstorm that makes a trip to the outhouse dangerous. Hilly fires her over the objections of her own mother, Mrs. Walters (\nSissy Spacek\n). In retaliation, Minny makes a chocolate pie into which she has baked her own feces, and takes it to Hilly in a fake act of contrition. While Hilly greedily eats two slices, she asks why her mother can't have a slice, to which Minny explains that it's a \"special pie, just for Miss Hilly.\" A moment later Minny tells Hilly, \"Eat my shit!\" Hilly asks if Minny's lost her mind, and Minny replies, \"No, ma'am, but you is about to. 'Cause you just did.\" Hilly's mother laughs and laughs and Hilly retaliates by having her mother committed to a nursing home.\nLater that night, Minny's husband beats her while Aibileen listens on the phone.\nAt church the next day, Aibileen hears a sermon about courage and changing her mind, resolves to help Skeeter with her book. She tearfully recounts to Skeeter and Minny the story of her son's death years before: At age twenty-four, Aibileen's son was run over by a truck at his workplace. The white foreman drove him to a colored hospital, dumped him on the ground, honked the horn, and left. By that point it was too late to save him, so Aibileen brought him home, where he died on the sofa right before her eyes. She expresses her pain, saying \"The anniversary of his death comes every year, and every year I can't breathe. But to you all, it's just another day of bridge.\" She becomes even more invested in the dangerous book project.\nMeanwhile Minny goes to work for Celia Foote, who's had no luck breaking into the Junior League social set and is therefore somewhat isolated. Celia pays Minny under the table because she doesn't want her husband to know that she has no domestic skills. Although she is generally suspicious of white people, Minny finds herself becoming more comfortable around Celia, who is bubbly and treats Minny with respect, but is deeply insecure. Minny improves Celia's dismal cooking skills by teaching her how to make fried chicken on her first day. They bond further when Celia suffers her fourth miscarriage. While Minny helps her into bed and soothes her, Celia is overwrought. She reveals that she married her husband Johnny (\nMike Vogel\n) because she was pregnant, but quickly lost the baby and hasn't told him about the three failed pregnancies that followed. She worries that she will never be able to have children.\nHilly's new maid, Yule Mae (\nAunjanue Ellis-Taylor\n), explains to her employer that her twin sons have graduated high school and that she and her husband have been saving for years to send them to college. However, they are short $75 on one tuition, and are on the verge of having to choose which son can go. Yule Mae respectfully asks Hilly for a loan, saying that she will gladly work for free until the loan is paid off. Hilly refuses, explaining that it's \"the Christian thing\" to do because God does not give charity to those who are well and able. While vacuuming Hilly's living room later, Yule Mae finds a ring, which she pockets and later tries to pawn, hoping to get the tuition money. Hilly finds out and has Yule Mae arrested at the bus stop in front of the other maids, all of whom are deeply shaken by the event.\nAibileen recruits a reluctant Minny into the book project, but Elaine Stein (who's warming to the idea) insists the book will need at least a dozen voices -- including the story of Skeeter's own relationship with Constantine. After Yule Mae's arrest, nearly all the local maids volunteer to help with the book. Though she has changed the names of everyone involved, Skeeter remains concerned that people will recognize the maids and create more trouble for the Negro community in the wake of the recent murder of Medgar Evars. Minny insists that they include the story about Hilly and the chocolate pie -- which she refers to as her \"terrible awful\" -- as insurance against being identified; an embarrassed Hilly will not want anyone to know that she ingested her maid's feces and will do all she can to convince everyone that the book isn't about Jackson.\nHilly has several times directed Skeeter, who writes the Junior League newsletter, to include an item about her proposed \"sanitation initiative,\" but Skeeter keeps putting her off. Now Hilly adds an item about a charity coat drive, the coats for which are to be dropped off at Hilly's house. Skeeter includes both items, but changes \"coats\" to something else.\nThe next day Elizabeth gets a call and rushes herself, Mae Mobley, and Aibileen over to Hilly's, where Hilly is screaming, \"I told her to write 'coats'! Not 'commodes'!\" On Hilly's lawn are about 40 toilets. While Hilly continues her histrionics, Mae Mobley innocently sits on a toilet and Elizabeth slaps her till she sobs. Mae Mobley runs to Aibileen, who holds her and whispers, \"You is kind. You is smart. You is important.\"\nSkeeter eventually pries the story of Constantine's departure out of her mother: Charlotte fired Constantine because Constantine's daughter Rachel (\nLaChanze\n) refused to use the back door and embarrassed Charlotte while she was hosting an important DAR luncheon. Charlotte regretted it and tried to get Constantine to come back, going so far as to send her son, Skeeter's brother, to Constantine's new home in Chicago, but by the time he got there, Constantine had died.\nSkeeter's book The Help is published anonymously, and soon everyone in Jackson is reading it. True to Minny's prediction, Hilly is horrified to find the chocolate pie story therein and goes out of her way to assure her friends that The Help isn't about Jackson. Skeeter splits the advance she receives evenly among all the maids, promising that more is on the way. She's offered a job at the publishing house in New York, which she is disinclined to take, but Aibileen and Minny insist that she must.\nStuart Whitworth (\nChristopher Lowell\n), whom Skeeter has been dating, breaks up with Skeeter when he finds out it was she who wrote The Help. Hilly also figures out who wrote the book and storms over to Skeeter's house in a drunken fury. She threatens to tell Skeeter's mother, but Charlotte kicks Hilly off her property after insulting her and insinuating she knows about the pie. Charlotte tells Skeeter to take the job in New York, which Skeeter does, and Charlotte tells her she's proud of her.\nCelia works hard to prepare a lavish meal for Minny in gratitude for all she has done. Celia's husband, who has known all along that Minny is working for Celia, tells Minny she will have a job with them for as long as she wants it. Inspired, Minny leaves her abusive husband, taking their children with her.\nOne of the final scenes shows Hilly taking in her mail. One item is a check for $200, a donation from Celia to the Junior League benefit. When she sees that the check is made out to \"Two-Slice Hilly,\" she throws a tantrum and tears it up.\nHilly, falsely claiming that Aibileen has stolen some silverware, browbeats the weak-willed Elizabeth into firing Aibileen. When alone with Aibileen, Hilly cruelly tells her that while she cannot send Aibileen to jail for her involvement in the book, she can send her \"for being a thief.\" Aibileen snaps and finally stands up to Hilly, calling her a \"godless woman\" for her false accusations and for her conniving and backstabbing ways, at which Hilly bursts into tears of rage and leaves. Mae Mobley begs Aibileen not to leave her. They share a tearful goodbye, during which Aibileen repeats her affirming mantra: \"You is kind. You is smart. You is important.\" Elizabeth shows a rare glimpse of emotion, tearing up as she watches Mae Mobley bang on the window, crying for Aibileen to return. As she walks away, Aibileen promises herself that she will become a writer, as her son had encouraged her to do.",

                "Greetings again from the darkness. The film is based on the controversial best selling novel by Kathryn Stockett. It was controversial because it is the story of Jim Crow-era maids written by a white woman. Yes, the book is actually the fictionalized story of a white woman getting black maids to discuss their lives as maids for white folks. Rather than get into some politically correct dissertation on the book, movie or story, I will only comment on the film itself ... this very entertaining movie that also manages to deliver a timeless message.Let me first start by saying that this movie is incredibly well acted. It is quite rare to have so many developed characters in one movie. There are some characters we immediately connect with, while others draw our ire each time their face appears. The script and these fine actresses utilize humor to point out the shameful behavior of those who saw themselves as superior. The humor doesn't soften the ignorance or abuse, but it does make the film infinitely more watchable and entertaining. Please know this is not a documentary.Ms. Stockett's novel has a very loyal following in addition to the naysayers. A two hour film must, of course, take short cuts and trim story lines. Still the key elements are present. Based in Jackson, Mississippi during Governor Ross Barnett's term we see the social shark, Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), in her full glory of ignorance, entitlement and superiority. We see her minions and followers emulating her moves while trying to gain her approval.The story takes off when Skeeter (Emma Stone) graduates from Ole Miss and returns home and takes a job at the local newspaper. Possessing observation skills and humanity that her lifelong friends can't comprehend, Skeeter desperately wants to tell a story from the perspective of the maids. As expected, the maids are hesitant, but Aibileen (Viola Davis) does relent. The stories begin to flow and soon the robust Minny (Octavia Spencer) joins in. Others soon follow their lead and Skeeter's education goes to an entirely new level.That's really all of the story I care to discuss. The brilliance of this one is actually in the details ... individual scenes and moments of acting genius by most of the cast. In addition to those mentioned above, Jessica Chastain plays Celia, the \"white trash\" outcast who so desperately wants to be allowed back into the girls' club. Ms. Chastain was seen a few weeks ago in the fabulous \"Tree of Life\" in quite a different role ... I would venture to say no actress will have two roles of such variance this year. Also, Allison Janney plays Skeeter's cancer-stricken mother, and Sissy Spacek is Hilly's mother who gets tossed aside before she is ready to go! The great Cicely Tyson makes a brief appearance as Constantine, Skeeter's childhood maid who was done so wrong after 29 years of service. Mary Steenburgen has a couple of scenes as a big NYC book publisher.As a said, this is pure acting heaven, but I must single out Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Viola is so powerful at the beginning and end of the film, and Ms. Spencer is a force of nature during the middle. This movie is really their story and these two ladies make it fascinating, painful and a joy to behold. They both deserve recognition at Oscar time.There are so many fantastic details to the film. At times, it is like watching a classic car show ... the late 50's and early 60's models are works of art. The wardrobe, hair and make-up are perfect in setting up the class differentials. The TV and radio segments provide context and timing with the deaths of Medger Evers and JFK. Even the books on Skeeter's shelf make a statement: To Kill a Mockingbird, Huck Finn, Native Son, and Gone With the Wind.This story takes place 50 years ago and director Tate Taylor does an admirable job of bringing Stockett's novel to the big screen. Mr. Taylor is a longtime friend of Ms. Stockett's and was quite fortunate to get the directing rights. He doesn't disappoint. Sure the story is a bit glossy at times ... it is geared towards the masses. If you are looking for more depth, there are numerous documentaries available on the Civil Rights movement. If you are seeking a very entertaining movie that uses humor to tell a story and send a message, then this one's for you.",

                "My wife read this book for a college class and she loved it. The I told her my mom had the movie and she wanted to watch it after she read the book. She invited me to watch it with her, and I have to say I loved it from start to finish.This is a story about prejudice, hate, anger, love, sadness, courage, and doing the right thing. It takes place in the south during 1960 a time of racism and violence, a time when Martin Luther King Jr did his famous march for African American rights. A time when blacks were still considered the lowest of the low. The story is about two African American women and a white writer, together they collect stories about how abusive, rude, and cruel the white society of the south really could be. I am a big history buff, and I know of the times of the 1960's. This movie rings true to everything that went on in the south during this time. Having had parents that grew up during this time but not in the south they knew of this. The reason it is called the help is because it is about a group of African American house keepers the serve high white southern society, who basically raise their children for them because their mothers are to busy with social matters. As I watched the film it struck me hard, how could these mothers just abandon their children? These African American women basically raise them and these children look to them as mothers and caretakers, and when they leave or get fired these children miss them so much. The white writer who is played well by Emma Stone was basically raised by one, and is planning to write a book about these caretakers stories. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will cheer when good things come about. I loved the character Minnie and her sassyness and attitude she was my favorite character, though I liked all of them, I didn't like Bryce Dallas Howard's character Hilly, she was a stuck up, rude, snobbish, evil character who disgusted me throughout the entire movie. You cheer inside when the good characters triumph over her. This film also will open your eyes to what really went on during the south during the civil rights movement. For my generation I do believe this film needs to be watched and understood and after watching this movie I started asking my parents who were just barely teenagers at this time lots and lots of questions. And I also want to read the book. Racism still goes on today though not as big as it was back then. I invite you to watch this movie, your eyes will be opened and you will enjoy it too. You will get an appreciation that we are all people and that You is kind, You is smart, and You is important. 10/10 for The Help",

                "I grew up in the 60's, the setting for The Help, a story of Southern prejudice and cruelty toward African Americans, who were chattel of the Southern rich treating their servants as expendable and marginal. I can say that as a Northerner with a black maid for our household, there was love but always a barrier, a carryover from the strict separation still prevailing after reconstruction.Director Tate Taylor keeps the race relations taut but not strident, as if we were living through the emerging civil rights movement slowly but inevitably aimed at equality, not \"separate but equal.\" Skeeter (Emma Stone) graduates, returns to Jackson, Miss., and decides to write about the black help, whose \"perspective' needs to be told. As more maids join in the writing of the manuscript, the more possible it is to counter the assassination of Medgar Evers and eventually that of Martin Luther King.While we have grown used to the base scatological humor of the Hangovers, Change-UP, and other rom-coms, the fundament motif in The Help is as low-key as will ever be depicted in film. Not only is the idea of the bad guys \"eating s\u2014t\" effective, it is funny and poignant.A note about the performances\u2014Bryce Dallas Howard as the conservative, prejudiced Hilly, is remarkably successful, making her a full-fledged actress and not just a famous director's daughter. Jessica Chastain as the ditzy but big-hearted Celia Foote cements her place as a great modern actress following her memorable role as the compliant wife in Tree of Life. Emma Stone no longer need rely on rom-coms, for she stars in The Help with a performance nuanced and underplayed, just the way I like it, albeit a bit too hip for the times.Although the film tends toward the simplistic, e.g., there are no bad blacks and most whites are obtuse, Viola Davis as maid Aibileen Clark successfully carries the film displaying the ambivalent nature of slavery ready to burst out of its chains.",

She was not thrilled when I told her we were going to see a film that told a story from the civil rights era but when we left she said she loved it because of the women's courage, their humor and the power of their friendships. We had never seen most of the actors which was refreshing and the acting by the entire cast made it easy to get totally involved. I laughed out loud and shed quite a few tears in The Help, and will remember it and recommend it to my friends. It was wonderful to see so many scenes in which the actors related to each other so perfectly. Even the vilest characters showed moments of conflict within themselves as they played out poor behavior that had long been inbred in them. I am especially grateful to the team who provided a film that told an engaging story about human relationships with important lessons for my daughter. That is a rare occurrence in today's movies.",

                "There have been a number of films about the Deep South during the Civil Rights era, mostly (\"Mississippi Burning\" and \"Ghosts of Mississippi\" being examples) concentrating on the political struggle for equality. \"The Help\" is a recent film which brings a slightly different approach to this period, concentrating on the relationship between well-to-do white Southerners and their black maids. Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan is a young white woman from a wealthy family in Jackson, Mississippi. She has ambitions to make a career in writing and journalism, and plans to write a book about the experiences of black maids (referred to as \"the help\") working for white families. Unlike most of her friends, Skeeter is a liberal on racial issues and is horrified by the bigoted views which she has heard other white women express, often quite openly in front of their black servants. She hopes that her book will help to expose this sort of prejudice, but finds that no maids are willing to be interviewed. Eventually, however, two maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, come forward. Both have good cause to be dissatisfied with their employers, especially Minny who has not only been sacked but also falsely accused of theft. Minny's employer Hilly is a particularly unpleasant individual, with an obsession with forcing black maids to use separate toilet facilities from the families they work for. The real reason for Minny's sacking was that she used the family's indoor bathroom rather than use an outside toilet during a thunderstorm. (One thing I have never understood why people like Hilly, who obviously has a poisonous dislike of all black people, did not simply employ a white maid; perhaps they could not find any white women willing to work for the low wages that black maids were paid). Some films with a \"civil rights\" theme, \"Mississippi Burning\" being an example, have a male-dominated cast, but \"The Help\" is very much a \"women's film\" with all the main roles, both heroines and villains, being taken by women. There is an attempt to give Skeeter a boyfriend, but their brief friendship- it never really deserves the name \"romance\"- fizzles out when he disapproves of her book and of her views on the race question. With that exception, all the male actors play very minor roles. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard from \"The Village\" and Viola Davis, who greatly impressed me in \"Doubt\", most of the leading actresses in the film were faces I had never seen before. (I must admit that I did not recognise Howard, here a brunette although normally a redhead). I understand that Jessica Chastain actually made seven feature films in 2011- a quite remarkable work-rate for a modern actress- but this is the only one I have yet seen. Chastain plays Celia Foote, Skeeter's only ally among Jackson's housewives. Although Celia's husband is from the city's wealthy elite, she herself is from a working-class background, which means that the likes of Hilly despise her as poor white trash who has got above herself. Although historically many poor whites were just as racist as rich ones, if not more so, Celia's experience of being on the receiving end of bigotry makes her a much more liberal employer. (Minny goes to work for her after being sacked by Hilly). Chastain's is one of a number of excellent performances in this film; the others come from Emma Stone as Skeeter, Davis (even better here than she was in \"Doubt\") as Aibileen and Octavia Spencer as the sharp-tongued Minny, a woman determined to fight back against prejudice. (Spencer won a \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar). I would have a couple of criticisms of the film. Howard as Hilly, like some of the other actresses playing the snooty society matrons, plays her character rather too much as a one-dimensional stereotype, the snobbish upper-class bitch. The sub-plot involving Minny's chocolate pie seemed out of place, the sort of vulgar humour which would be more at home in a Farrelly Brothers gross-out comedy than in a supposedly serious film. I would not, however, agree with the criticism some have made that the film demeans African-Americans by showing them as dependent upon whites for their emancipation. It is the black characters here who display real courage in bringing their working conditions to public notice, far more so than does Skeeter. She risks nothing worse than losing the friendship of a few people she never cared for in the first place; they risk the loss of their jobs and their livelihoods, and possibly also violence from white racists.Despite my criticisms, I felt that overall \"The Help\" was an excellent film- a well-acted, emotionally satisfying human drama with some powerful acting performances, and one which shed an interesting light on this period of American history. 8/10",

                "While \"The Help\" has received TONS of great press and a ton of SAG and other awards, I am also aware that there is some controversy concerning the film. Some people have felt that the film was a bit paternalistic--as it might be interpreted as yet another story of a rich, enlightened white lady going out to help all the downtrodden black folk. I am just not sure if I could see this or not--especially as the black women in the film end up showing LOTS of strength during the course of the film. BUT, I am also a white guy--and it's not fair for me to automatically brand the film one way or another. Just be aware that there are a few who resent the idea of this film.I could discuss the plot, but LOTS of other reviewers have discussed this. So instead, let's talk about what I liked and didn't like. I liked the acting. The problem, however, is that giving any of these actresses awards is tough as it's such an ensemble cast. I can truly understand why the Screen Actor's Guild chose to award ALL the cast a joint award. The direction was very nice and the movie was well filmed. The script was also very nice--and quite inspiring. My quibbles are VERY small---very, very small. I felt that a few characters were a bit one-dimensional (particularly the lead villainess). Also, the ending of the film seemed to drag out a bit and wrapping it up a bit sooner. It wasn't a bad ending--but tightening would have heightened the overall emotional impact.So my advice for you is to see this film. While I still think \"Hugo\" is the best nominated film this year, I can see the merit in \"The Help\" winning and \"The Artist\" sure seems to have a lot of momentum. So, do yourself a favor and see all three--all three are terrific.",

                "If this film were total fiction bearing no relation to reality, it would still be worth seeing for the fine acting and production values--even if some of the young white women approached \"Southern Gothic.\" But it wasn't fiction--at least, the depiction of Southern society wasn't. As I watched I kept drifting back to small-town South Carolina in the 1950s, where I grew up. It was moving and disturbing to be reminded how black people were treated then--loved and yet \"kept down in their place.\" Our neighborhood was all middle-class and every family had a maid. There were plenty of boys my age, we visited in each other's homes, and called every maid by her first name. One even started a baseball team for the little white boys, for which her reward was a visit by the Klan.Our maid helped my mother cook and clean. One of my parents picked her up and took her home every day--and she rode in the back seat. She ate her lunch in our kitchen--without being allowed to use our utensils. I remember her eating with her fingers. I do not remember ever seeing her use our bathrooms. I thought about that during the movie and truly cannot recall what she did, an embarrassing gap in memory.I do remember when my father was out of work and our maid had to be cut back to three days a week. I actually cried; she was a member of our family. When talk about civil rights began in the late 1950s, my mother became annoyed at our maid for getting \"uppity.\" And so it went. We moved to central Florida in 1961, where there were no maids.Travel back in time with this film. It's quite real, and I highly recommend it.",

                "The Help is one of the many films that's set in the 60s that deals with themes like prejudice and racism involving segregation amongst the Whites and the African Americans in Jackson, Mississippi, but having the very same themes also being relevant in society today even here in Singapore especially, with recent talk and focus on the issue of domestic help and our attitudes toward household maids that many employ for various reasons, who assist in looking after the children and the elderly, as well as to keep home while the rest of the adults are neck deep in economic pursuits. While racism is generally kept under control here, there are niggling incidents that pop up every now and then, so clearly we're not off the hook and there will always be individuals who choose intolerance.Granted that racism back then was more pronounced especially during that era put on film, the story's based on an international bestseller written by Kathryn Stockett, and over here we're bound to identify with the issues highlighted especially in the horror stories you'd hear with regards to the treatment of domestic help, with abuse cases that make you sit up and wonder why we are capable of such inhumane acts. And the worst of all involves being hypocritical, putting on a false front for society, while clearly behaving like the devil when behind closed doors. The bottom line is, we're all humans and we share similar hopes and dreams whatever our skin colour, language and where we're from, in desiring a comfortable life filled with love, with a roof over our heads, food and community, friends and family we can turn to in times of need. Which is why this film has themes and a poignant, thought provoking narrative that screams relevance, especially for those closeted intolerant few who must watch this, and reflect. Emma Stone stars as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, an aspiring journalist who has returned home only to find out that the group of peers she had grown up with, are leading a lifestyle of superficial leisure, saying a lot of things, but meaning nothing. And for all their cliquish behaviour in cruelly treating one of their own as a social outcast (Jessica Chastain from The Tree of Life), for an ulterior reason only Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) knows, what more their household maids who have to slog with the chores, be that surrogate mother to their kids, be at their beck and call, and being given attitude, stick, and threats of the sack?Given the tension all round during the time, it's no wonder that Skeeter's plans to want to highlight The Help's predicament and provide them with a voice, no doubt also serving as a ticket for her journalistic ambitions to embark on a career in New York, all met with stone walled silence, until Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) decided that enough is enough, and begin opening up to Skeeter as research material, becoming her insights and perspective on how the African American help get treated in White households. And besides Aibileen's point of view, her friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) also chipped in, and both represent the broad spectrum of heartfelt accounts both good and bad, though largely negative, with the tacit understanding with Skeeter that they are not to be referred to directly.It's one of those powerful films that takes the ugly side of humanity and presents it to us face on, to confront how cruel some of us can be, and what the strong amongst us must do to act and help those who are weak or bullied. Director Tate Taylor, who also wrote the screenplay, focuses on the tales crafted around the households both Aibileen and Minny serve, from being treated like dirt to forming firm friendships with some of the people they know and serve, such as Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain), as a reminder on how we should never judge a book by its cover, being obviously relevant when one gets handed one's fate for being of a certain skin colour. You may think that this may be a heavy film with all its seriousness, but trust me there is enough light hearted, even heart warming moments scattered throughout, though counter-balanced with moments of fear that will make you worry for the characters since mob mentality can lead to anything.Emma Stone normally plays kooky characters of late, so this was perfect opportunity for her to shine in more serious drama which she does adequately. But she got upstaged by both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the former who brought a certain quiet dignity to her role which just calls for respect, and the latter being the comic relief as a really straight-talker, and whose story was probably the most touching in the film, with one of the funniest, running gag in the later half. Bryce Dallas Howard also owned her role as the antagonist Hilly in the film, and if you'd think she's only capable of goody two shoes roles, think again as she can convincingly play back-stabbers, with Sissy Spacek in a supporting role as Hilly's mom.The Help reminds us of how one has to have Fear and Courage to addresses changes in community or the larger society we serve in, without which we would all be poorer for it. It may be almost 2 1/2 hours long, but it's every minute worth it just watching how an uphill battle was fought, and baby steps being taken each time to overcome obstacles placed in the characters' way. It's guaranteed that you'll laugh and you'll cry in the film thanks to its material, and it's firmly one of the contenders to be amongst my favourite films of this year. Highly recommended!",

To say it is not a story that I am normally interested in would be an understatement. I wasn't around during the time of segregation to fully appreciate the depth of this story. Additionally, if there was ever a movie that screamed \"chick flick\" it would be this one. In spite of that, I've heard wonderful things about the book and decided to view the movie. I'm happy to say that I'm glad that I did. Virtually unknown director Tate Taylor put together a cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses that truly made the story go. Taylor, whose last movie was the little seen Pretty Ugly People, grabbed a familiar actress to join him in making The Help, Allison Janney. Other than Janney the only other familiar actresses in the movie are Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek. The rather unknown cast has a fresh feeling on the story and there are no preconceived notions based on a past actor or actresses work. That being said Emma Stone (Easy A), and Viola Davis had a true coming out party in The Help. Both women played fantastic parts, which really made the cast mesh nicely together. Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain were all spectacular in supporting roles alongside Stone and Davis.When a movie doesn't have the explosions, crazy action or crude humor that we've become accustomed to seeing in newer movies there has got to be a great story attached in order to maintain your interest; The Help had that great story. There aren't many movies that have you laughing, crying, or getting angry and end up still being fantastic and that is where this one had me.

I didn't read the book and I assumed, based on the fact that this is a virtually an all-female cast, that this was some sort of chick flick. Boy, was I wrong! This is an incredible film that not only pays justice to the bestseller on which it's based (according to those who have read the book AND seen the film), but is phenomenally cast, with exceptional performances by Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard and Allison Janney. Veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson also deliver incredible performances. While Tyson's character is central to the storyline, her role comprises what seems to be a few, precious minutes of the 2:20 running time, she delivers, in my opinion, one of the most powerful and moving moments in the film...one in which she doesn't even utter a line (trust me, you'll know when you see it.)The Help also delivers some very funny moments and will make you laugh. I'll go so far as to say that this film and a few of its cast members will draw some Oscar nominations. I certainly think this takes Stone into a whole new level.The racial imbalances of 1963 are well illustrated in \"The Help,\" and will, no doubt, underscore how far America has come, as well as how little progress we've made in the last 50 years.

                "I just got back from a special-screening of \"The Help\" at my local movie theatre, so I thought that I might as well do a review for all of you who are wanting to see this movie when it comes out.Now, first off, I must admit that I have only read a portion of the book, but I definitely do know a lot about it. After watching the trailer, I was intrigued, so of course, I visited the IMDb boards to learn more about it. At first glance, the casting caught my attention big-time. Emma Stone as 'Skeeter'? I bet most people were as shocked as I was to find out that she was cast as the main character -- but let me tell you what: the casting was superb! I could not have chosen a better cast than what was already chosen. There was amazing chemistry between both the antagonists and protagonists. I won't go into too much depth about the characters, but for me, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, and Octavia Spencer were the shining stars of the movie.Casting: 9.5/10 I know that there has been an on-going issue about this movie from a lot of people claiming that \"the blacks had to be 'saved' by the whites\" (pardon the language), or something along those lines. I have to agree that the trailer does give off that type of vibe -- Skeeter saving the colored-folks -- however, the movie tells and depicts otherwise - the colored-folks actually saved themselves. Minny and Aibileen, as well as the other colored-folks in the community, were the real \"heroes\" of the movie; they just needed someone to push them to their potential (Skeeter).I can not remember the last time I saw a movie that inspired me, made me cry, made me laugh, and made me sad, angry, and hopeful, all at the same time -- this is what \"The Help\" strides and aims for, without making it \"cheesy\". Without a doubt in my mind, there are definitely Oscar-worthy performances in this movie. Not only does this movie depict just the colored-folks' side of the story, but it also equally shows the feelings of the white-folks, as well. So, you definitely get both sides of the story without it being more or less \"mean\" or \"degrading\" to any sides.There are definitely a few awkward moments in the movie, but what movie doesn't have them? This movie started around 7:10 and ended around 9:20 -- about 2 hours and 10 minutes, give or take, if my calculations are correct. However, this movie only felt like it was an hour-long. It was so good that I didn't even know the two hours passed by until the theatre lights lid and the rolling credits began.All in all, this is a DEFINITELY-MUST-SEE movie. I personally believe that it is one of the best movies of 2011. Go see it -- you will not regret it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.Movie rating: 9/10",

There are so few roles written for black women and I was thrilled to see such great roles filled by Viola Davis (Abigail) and Octavia Spencer (Minnie) - both should be nominated for supporting roles although in my opinion, along with Emma Stone, all three share top billing.The character development in this movie is really outstanding \u2013 I hate movies with flat single dimension characters and these from the lowest to those with the most screen time are just remarkably developed \u2013 even the newspaper editor, the lines they chose for him to keep gave you enough information that even he is a memorable character with only three scenes, maybe 4 in the entire movie. Same for Stuart, Skeeter's love interest \u2013 you actually like him then hate him and he only has maybe 3 minutes of air time. Great great job. Sissy Spacek with so few speaking moments is great as is Cicely Tyson who speaks volumes even in scenes with no words. Admittedly, being based on an amazing book the background story was already set out and tracks the book closely without some of the details but they have done a great job of putting it to film \u2013 This movie sets out beautifully a terrible time in our history that unfortunately is not over \u2013 it is better, but not over by a long shot. Being a child of the south and coming up during that time, being raised by such bigoted grandparents and parents, it leaves me pause to wonder how I avoided this rabid virus of hate and takes me back to long hot lazy days in the deep south before every building was air conditioned \u2013 such attention detail right down to the Jesus fans they waved in church \u2013 awesome flick. You FEEL the heat, the tension, the pain, the injustice of the time but still you laugh with them even as you cry for them - both races - ignorance is to be wept over.However, I think this movie does more, goes further in its exploration of the behavior of the privileged during that time. They were rabid toward blacks but were not that much better toward anyone who did not share their socio-economic status (the way the \"Junior League\" treated Celia) and the enormous peer pressure they put on one another (the club encouraging Skeeter's mother to make a poor decision).

                "In Jackson, Mississippi, in the 60's, the aspirant writer Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has just graduated and returns home after finding a job writing in a futile newspaper column in the local newspaper. When she arrives home, she finds that her nanny and family's maid Constantine Jefferson (Cicely Tyson) is gone. Skeeter sees the chance of writing a book about the relationship of the black maids with the Southern society for an editor from New York. First she convinces Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) to open her heart to her; then Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) is unfairly fired by the arrogant Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is a leader in the racist high society, and Minny decides to tell her stories after finding a job with the outcast Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain). Soon eleven other maids accept to be interviewed by Skeeter that also tells the truth about Constantine. When the book \"The Help\" is released, Jackson's high society will never be the same.\"The Help\" is an unforgettable movie about a forgettable time in the history of the United States of America. The engaging story is supported by magnificent performances and the viewer does not feel the 146 minutes running time. The performances of Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain are top-notch and all of them deserved at least nomination to the Oscar and major film festivals. The direction is tight and art direction is very realistic. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Hist\u00f3rias Cruzadas\" (\"Entwined Stories\")",

                "The Help is set in the 1960's where colored people had little to no rights and mainly focuses on the colored maids working for the \"white\" people.I didn't really want to see the movie but it got great reviews so I decided to check it out. I must say this movie was quite touching and very well done.The cast is excellent with award worthy performances from Viola Davis, Emma Stone and Octavia Spencer - the main cast. The acting was amazing and there was great chemistry among the respectful classes of people in the film ( the whites and the blacks).The script was well written and I love the balance of comedy and drama. There are some intense scenes however the comedy makes the movie more enjoyable rather than just a movie to make you feel sad all the way through. There was a perfects balance there and I loved that. The film also took you on a roller-coaster of emotions. Sometimes you were sad, extremely happy, angry or laughing. Its also one of those movies that can hold your interest from beginning to end.With great performances, a brilliant script and a film so touching and inspiring, The Help is definitely a must-see!",

                "'The Help' is a well-meaning attempt to educate the film going public about the civil rights era in the deep South through the perspective of the relationship between black maids and their white female employers.\u00a0 Author Kathryn Stockett, who wrote the book on which the film is based, does well in reminding us that the black 'help' not only had to endure the threat of violence as a result of the encroaching backlash from white racists upset over a new black militancy in southern communities, but also had to deal with a multiplicity of indignities on the drab domestic front, including being forced to use separate bathrooms in the homes of their white female employers.\u00a0 Not only does Hilly Holbrook (the film's principal 'villain') enforce this rule in her own home and influences her immediate neighbors to follow suit, but lobbies local politicians in order to have her racist initiative be codified into law.While Hilly may be a tad bit melodramatic as Stockett's 'Cruella de Vil', she is undoubtedly the most compelling character in the entire film. Stockett also does well with Elizabeth Leefolt, Aibileen's racist employer, who is perhaps more repulsive than Hilly, in that she does not have the self-awareness to realize that she is an incompetent mother. Occasionally, Stockett even suggests that some of oppressed maids may not have all their moral compasses in order. In perhaps one of the most interesting scenes in the film (due to the ambiguity), one of the maids is roughly pulled off a bus and arrested by seemingly racist, redneck policeman. I could hear the indignant sounds of the audience suddenly go quiet, when it's revealed that the maid arrested was the one who pilfered a diamond ring that had fallen behind a cabinet in the home of one of the white employers.Despite Stockett's noble attempt to relate the atmosphere of institutional racism so prevalent in the south during early 1960s, her main character, Skeeter, feels wholly anachronistic. It's as if Stockett projected her own modern day sensibility on to Skeeter and asks us to believe that such a character would have existed at that time. If there were progressive minded white liberals participating in the civil rights movement in the early 60s, usually they came from the north and were often met with outright violence. To have such a progressive minded white female from the south take up the cause of the oppressed black 'help', let alone create a book based on interviews with such women, is simply wish fulfillment on the part of the author. Stockett is obviously trying to mitigate some of her own guilt by creating the illusory, \"feel-good\" character of Skeeter. No book like \"The Help\" ever appeared in the early 60s and it would have never been published at that time.There's another reason why 'The Help' makes little sense. Why would \"The Help\" ever agree to Skeeter's plan? They certainly receive little financial compensation for their efforts and in the end, they're only setting themselves up for retaliation. A character in a book might take some satisfaction in mouthing off against an employer who subjects them to racist humiliation, but in the real world (and especially in the 60s deep South), one doesn't 'talk back', unless one wants to lose their sole source of support. Of course there were individual black women who worked as maids who could have 'talked back' and lost their jobs, but to suggest such a large group of women agreed to interviews en masse, is another one of Stockett's 'feel-good' conceits! While all those juicy interviews Stockett collected from the 'Help' may have worked in the book, the stories come off as dry recitations in the film. We don't actually experience the maids' stories visually\u2014they are merely communicated to Skeeter during the interviews. Obviously, flashbacks wouldn't have worked during the interview scenes since there were too many of them. Stockett's other big problem with the 'Help' is that she's forced to place her main 'Help' characters on a pedestal. Yes Aibileen and Minny ARE victims but can they do no wrong? It may have been a more interesting story if \"The Help\" were REALLY told from their perspective. Stockett unfortunately is unable to make the Help's world come alive\u2014do they actually have a back story? (the best we get is an allusion to Minny's \"abusive\" husband who never appears on screen). Or is everything defined by their relationship to the white world?Stockett resorts to melodramatic form, by offering up storytelling akin to a decidedly unsubtle 'quid pro quo.' You have your evil Hilly and then you need to counter it with the ditsy but kind Cecelia Foote, another unbelievable character designed to prove that whites weren't all that bad during the era. Even Charlotte, Skeeter's mother, must be subject to Stockett's quid pro quo treatment (Charlotte channels Hilly when she banishes beloved family maid Constantin in order to appease her racist club members but then sticks up for Skeeter when Hilly tries to blackmail her daughter).Worst of all are Stockett's male characters who are practically non-existent in the film. I didn't buy for one second that Skeeter would have actually been attracted to the boyfriend and gone out with him for a time. Wouldn't she have clarified from the beginning that he was a racist and had nothing to do with him? For those who are interested in getting a better picture of black life during the civil rights era, can I recommend the classic 1964 picture, 'Nothing But a Man'? 'The Help' only seems to suggest that white people deserve more credit than they really should receive for aiding black people in their quest for social equality and justice.",

                "So....I went and saw The Help last night.I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't as offensive as \"The Blind Side\" (ala the big overgrown, illiterate, strong as an ox, loyal, gullible, clown saved by a white Christian savior caricature) but the overall story was pretty watered down. The acting is solid, but I was torn about this movie. It does elicit the \"Great White Hope\" character, in that the maids only come together through the unlikely liberalism and goodness of a young white character. Its message for the future is also disturbing. For example, toward the end, one maid is offered salvation by a white couple who offers her the security of being their maid for the REST OF HER LIFE...a deal that makes her eyes grow wide with happiness. Meanwhile, the main white character goes off to greener pastures outside the limitations of her town.There are also some unsettling caricatures...like a \"Mammy\" figure who gets misty eyed when she talks about how frying chicken makes her feel good inside.I think they were pretty spot on in the portrayal of the white \"southern belles (given that I'm from Jackson myself).\" They were mostly ridiculous, petty and cold...which, to my understanding, is how they really were. It makes for some good comedic moments.This is a \"safe\" film...there's no violence, and the threat of violence doesn't feel very immediate or nearby. The racism of the day feels like an omniscient boogey-man...and the white men in the film are all portrayed in an indifferent \"they could care less\" light...which seems VERY unbelievable. And the Black men were either abusive, docile or messengers...I mean, not a single, strong Black man?The real sad thing about this film is what it says about Black progress in Hollywood. I haven't seen \"real\" roles for black women this year...and it's telling that the project that employs the most black women at once is one where they all have to play maids. Even in a trailer shown before this film for \"Tower Heist,\" Gabourey Sidibe (from \"Precious\") is playing a maid...complemented by Eddie Murphy playing a convict with expert knowledge on robberies. So, blacks are either subservient, criminals, comedic clowns...or the ever present \"token black friend.\" The exception to this rule are the few Blacks that are seen as being \"negro-lite\"...e.g. Will Smith, Halle Berry and Beyonce. Many whites don't understand why Blacks are sensitive to their portrayals on film...but whites have to realize...you have an abundance of images to choose from. However, we have very few. Imagine taking your children to the movies...and the people that look like them, on screen, are usually stupefied, marginalized, subservient or comedic to the point of buffoorney. That's not the reality whites EVER have to accept, adapt to or address. This is not playing the race card...as there is no card to play when this is your life.My grandmother was a maid, like these women in the film. She went to work every day for the local car dealer's family...doing housework, cooking their meals and taking care of their kids for $5/day. She supplemented her income ironing white people's clothes from town. She raised 10 kids and helped with the war effort at home. While a film like \"The Help\" gives her a voice, it also robs her of hope that things will get better. After all, one maid quits her job even though her options are extremely limited and she has jeopardized her own safety by helping Skeeter...the other maid accepts a position to be the lifetime maid of another couple and then leaves her abusive husband...and the third maid that we come to know is rotting in jail. The only people who make out with better futures are the white characters....Skeeter is off to New York. Celia learns how to cook and, through the \"wisdom\" of her maid, learns how to communicate with her husband and develops self worth. The young white child Viola was raising may get a \"fighting chance\" because Viola tells her mother to give her one. And Hilly may actually become a better person who's finally learned the error of her ways.Finally, there is one part that really summarized this whole film to me. At one point, Skeeter is sitting at Viola Davis's table. She asks her if she ever wanted to do anything else rather than be a maid. Viola Davis nods...and Skeeter never follows up with her to ask her what she wanted to do. My feeling was she didn't ask because it was irrelevant...irrelevant to the story and to the reality of the time. Black women didn't have choices, so there was no reason to speak of dreams that they both knew were empty.All in all, I think this film is a nice effort for what it was, and fluff for what it was not.6.5/10",

                "14 August 2011. The unintentional and revealing shock of this movie isn't how the trailers and previews misled the audience as to the nature of this movie, but that the marketing arm and distributor felt that it was necessary (perhaps rightly so) to depict the movie more as primarily a comedy rather than a drama in the first place. Fifty years after this period piece takes place, the irony is that the emotional drama and power of this movie arises for its \"contemporary\" audience from the likelihood that we can be shocked by this movie at all and its ability to push the audience's racial button after all this time. Like the hidden embarrassment of sexual products on commercial television, this movie seems to have dared to expose the dirty laundry in a balanced drama, lightened with elements of humor.Unlike The Stepford Wives (2004) that used comedy as its primary platform to expose the dichotomy of the 1950s with todays societal values, The Help in the same way Uncle Tom's Cabin published in 1852 (there were not movies back then) brings to the mainstream audience a serious but balanced and mainstream acceptable version of the racial divide of the 1950s. The Help is a break through movie for our times that oddly enough may or may not hold up in 50 or 100 years unless it becomes memorable for its revelation at least in mainstream movies, the racial blindness of its history America still retained so many years later at the Civil Rights era. Or maybe like Schindler's List (1993), the shocking but revealing World War II drama, The Help may be able to retain its historical value aside from its present day exposure of today's America's subconscious.The Help is a deeply revealing, emotional compelling inward look at America and allows mainstream America to become sensitively aware of the thin veneer that remains covering over the racial prejudice that still pervades America today, even as the gains made over the past 30,40 years have been wiped away, especially with the Great Recession and the political atmosphere that has become a backdrop of everyday existence for African Americans and other minorities in this Country.",

In it every character is a clich\u00e9 cartoon in support of a fictional rose coloured glasses version of 60's America, where almost every white person is a villain and every black person loves fried chicken. If this is how America learns its history (and judging by the reviews where many have viewed this film as having a positive and accurate message of hope and struggle????), then no wonder the western world is in trouble. Is it worse that a story about the struggle of black people to overcome oppression in racist 60s America is centered on a privileged white woman on the road to New York success? Marginalized yet again it seems. This movie started out as passable entertainment but by the time it crossed the finished line it had stepped full force into misguided and offensive.

                "This is a hard film to adequately review, because so much is right with it, yet at the same time so much is wrong. Or if not \"wrong,\" at least there are some major tones that simply did not work for me.The cast is spectacular. Emma Stone is not just adorable, but a skilled and marvelous actor. You don't need me to remark that she has a stellar career ahead of her. The rest of the cast includes some of those great character actors you see in the better films, but can't quite remember where you've seen them before. but that's a plus for a character actor, as their appearances, therefore, always seems fresh.It feels very awkward for me to mention the tone that felt wrong. The abuse and inhumane treatment endured by black people 50 years ago is hard to watch today. The pain inflicted, and the behavior of the oppressors can only be called an \"evil\" situation. One hopes that evolution has done its work, and social justice prevails today. If not perfectly, then at least to a tolerable degree.But that is part of the problem, to me. This film seems to merely recycle old tropes of injustice. It seems to be, as one of my professors used to call it, a \"pot stirrer.\" Lots of agitation and angst and shame and sympathy just for the sake of chaos--- but here it doesn't seem to be authentic. It certainly doesn't seem to go anywhere. It's almost as if the writer has taken an easy issue guaranteed to provoke outrage and anger, rather than doing the authentic, and difficult, artistic work necessary to invoke compassion and healing. This film might be, to be blunt, merely counterfeit social justice. It might be a brazen attempt to \"push buttons\" for undeserved sympathy. I sincerely hope I am mistaken, and overly unkind.Granted, that's a subtle point. But that's also why I found the theme of the film a bit objectionable- it seemed as if the filmmakers were taking advantage of most people's natural and gut-level decency to elicit an audience response on a tabloid level.Further, who would DARE to criticize this film? It's almost as if it were \"criticism proof.\" Therefore unsound dramatic treatments will go by without comment. Given that I think that was done deliberately, even if somewhat unconsciously, this movie takes an honorable and lofty struggle for which many people suffered and even died, and shamelessly exploits that to make a few bucks at the box office. Think about it- what insights or \"new\" themes were introduced here? I'd say none. It may be an example of what Plato called \"pandering,\" going for the cheap points via a stimulus-response fest.I hope I am wrong- I hope it is really just a matter of me not responding to this particular cinematic venture. If I am even partly right, however, it bodes ill for our modern shallow and thoughtless \"junk media\" environment.",

                "The film begins with Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) giving a brief insight into the lives herself and her community who work, for the most part, as domestic staff for the white elite of Jackson, Mississippi. How she's spent most of her life raising white children and how she'd recently lost her own son. And Minnie, her friend, (played by Octavia Spencer) loses her job due to an inability to abide by unjust rules and hold her tongue as she's expected to.Meanwhile, Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (played by Emma Stone) has returned home from college with a degree and plans to use it. An idea that is lost on her friends and family who saw college as a means to an end in their quest for suitable husbands who could support them and their future children in the manner they've become accustomed to thanks to their upbringing. And while Skeeter(Stone) finds a job writing a column about cooking and other matters she has little to no expertise on and a valuable resource for the column in Aibileen (Davis), she soon finds her real passion in chronicling the life, times, and injustices of African American domestic servants in Jackson.I've heard the criticisms leveled on this film and, in all honesty, they're not wrong. It's depiction of racism is, for the most part watered down or rose-colored. And the film's main antagonist is a twitchy social butterfly whose only real power is her standing. That might make sense if her near-senile mother weren't heckling her in the background during those important social events.

It is on one of those routine days going home that he finds at the Bedridge Station a puppy, who he eventually will learn was being shipped somewhere unknown, with the shipping tag lost. He also learns from Ken, a Japanese professor friend, that the dog is a Japanese breed called an Akita, and that the Japanese character on the dog&#39;s collar tag is the number eight - &quot;hachi&quot;. Parker does whatever he can to find out who the dog belongs to, and although his many acquaintances around the train station do their small part in helping Parker, no one is willing to take the dog, even temporarily. So Parker takes the dog home, despite he and his wife Cate long having dismissed the idea of having a dog. However Parker is able to convince her to let the dog stay temporarily. Eventually on the high probability that they will never find the dog&#39;s owner, Cate, upon seeing the interaction between the two, lets Parker permanently keep the dog, who he has since named Hachi.

Although not a &quot;typical&quot; dog in that Hachi will do not what most dogs do such as fetch, Hachi demonstrates an unwavering and lifelong loyalty to Parker in an unusual way that all around him can see.

Indeed, at first, Parker intended to find the dog&#39;s owner; but, instead, after realising that nobody claims the dog, he decided to keep the abandoned puppy, naming it Hachiko. Then, tragedy struck, giving the perfect example of the strong, the unwavering, and sometimes, the unexplainable bond that can form between a man and an animal."

        "synopsis": "This heartwarming true story is an American adaptation of a Japanese tale about a loyal dog named Hachiko. This very special friend would accompany his master to the train station every day and return each afternoon to greet him after work. Sadly his master goes to work one day, but dies at work and never returns to the station. Hachiko faithfully returns to the same spot at the station that evening, and every day until the last day of his life, to wait for his beloved master. During his daily visits, Hachiko touches the lives of many who work near and commute through the train station square. He teaches the local people love, compassion and above all, unyielding loyalty. Today, a bronze statue of Hachiko sits in his waiting spot outside the Shibuya station in Japan as a permanent reminder of his devotion and love.\n(NOTE: There is also a bronze statue of Hachiko now at the location in Rhode Island where this movie was filmed. It can be viewed on Google Street Maps by visiting 1 High St., Woonsocket, RI 02895)",

                "Knowing the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009) has been made in a sort of staged documentary style, similar to the kind of movies often seen on documentary channels (e.g. NatGeo), however without a narrator so common in documentaries, and including well-known actors (Richard Gere, Sarah Roemer and Joan Allen), making it more suitable for theatrical distribution.Before my last year's visit to Tokyo I've been unaware of the true-life story this movie is based upon. In time an occasion came up to meet a friend in Shibuya city, contemporary center of Tokyo's youth culture (shopping, fashion, nightlife...), and that's how I've learned about the popular local meeting point for all Tokyoites, the Hachik\u014d Akita dog statue just outside of Shibuya Train Station, but the real story behind it has been still eluding me ever since. After seeing this movie, and some additional research on the web, all pieces have fallen into place.In retelling the story of common bonding between the dog and its owner, so usual that it comes so natural, film is moving at slow pace, following events of an ordinary life, though not without occasional comedic and dramatic overtones. Even past the dramatic highpoint, when common acts of affection and loyalty evolve towards such an unheard-of faithfulness and ultimate devotion, pace of the storytelling does not change, relying primarily on fine details and emotional build-up. Of course, this might not attract everybody, providing that majority of movie audience today is highly dependent on fast paced, action packed scenes, getting thrills from 3D CG stylized ambiance and suspense, high volume amplitudes and aggressive, often rude highlights of any other nature. However, for those who can do without it, and keep alive their interest even in a simple story, who won't shy away from emotional involvement (as if this can be controlled), they shall easily find themselves consumed by its mere beauty and warmth. Usual man's-best-friend story, spiced with an intriguing yet inspiring detail, shall leave you a bit sad, inevitably pensive, but ultimately delighted. Even more so after the reading of the real-life epilogue.",

                "Oh my, hold everything. You want to be prepared to watch this movie with plenty of Kleenex on hand. It really does resonate for viewers who have a special bond with their pets, but I think it probably moves a few hearts of those who don't share hearth and home with a favorite canine. It's a bit ironic actually, to think about the picture's impact on a person, when a dog's reaction to it's missing owner invites more sympathy than one feels for the owner himself, who died of a heart attack.Well, not to get too morbid, this was a sensitively told tale that one finds astonishingly hard to believe when it's revealed that Hachi celebrated his master for ten years after the man's death by showing up daily at a train station at the end of the work day to greet him. Based on an actual event that occurred in Japan in the 1920's, the film has been Westernized for an American audience with Richard Gere in the lead role as a university professor who adopts a wayward Akita puppy found wandering around a train station. But the real star is the pup who matures into the adult Hachi and takes full possession of the viewer's emotions on the way to a heart tugging finish. It's a family friendly film that you're not likely to forget for a long time once you've seen it.",

                "Hachi is a movie based on the true story about a dog in Japan, Hachiko, who would wait at the train station every day for his owner to arrive even after the owner passed away.I have never seen the original Japanese version of the movie but know the story well as I have been told by many people here in Japan. There is a statue of Hachiko that stands outside of Shibuya Station in Tokyo. Now the statue is the most popular place for Tokyoites to meet their friends before going out shopping or dining in Shibuya.Unlike other Japanese remakes, this movie actually gives credit to the original story so that you don't get the sense that Hollywood wants to call it its own. All actors/actresses in the movie do a superb job in making you feel as if you were a part of the community embracing the dog. Compared to the original story, people were more accepting of Hachi rather than considering him a nuisance. Of course this is going to be released in the U.S. as a holiday movie so the goal is to make it uplifting.Just a warning, do take many tissues. I am a grown man and can honestly say that I have never really cried during a movie. I think the score of the movie plus the dog being so adorable made me lose myself. When I looked around the theater though, every single person was crying and I saw a lot of red eyes as I left the Men's restroom. Any movie that can make me do that deserves a 10/10.",

If the words \"love\" and \"loyalty\" mean anything to you, this is a nice story see unfold.The only major mistake made in this movie is that it should have been done as a 1920s period piece. I say that because throughout the story, the dog runs free around the town/city, which is impossible today with leash laws everywhere.Whatever, the story is still very good, very memorable and very touching in spots near the end. The only spoiler I'll use is a good one: if you fear watching an animal film with a bad/sad ending, you're safe: the dog survives....that's all I'll say on that.Kudos to Richard Gere for a nice performance.

                "Hachi A Dog's Tale (2009) :\nBrief ReviewEPIC !!! The longest sobbing i ever had for any film. After watching 2000+ films or may be even much more than that, after watching more than 100 tearjerkers, after watching more than 500 emotional sagas this Hachi A Dog's Tale recieved the Longest sobbing of my life. I remember so many films just because they made me cry like kid, i can name many just like that, just now but you know most of those films had that emotional roll down moments somewhere in the last scenes. It is mostly the climax where i had to use tissues but Hachi A Dog's Tale was like raining tears. I cried for approx 25 Minutes continuesly setting a new record for myself and may be for all movie buffs. I mean how emotional film it was despite the fact i tried to hold it acknowledging the fact that yes i am a movie buff and i had to look for Cinematic proportions before breaking down and fortunately there were no cinematic blunders, no mistakes in writing, no loopholes, no non-sense theories and I was all free to cry like a small kid as if i am locked in an empty room and no one's watching me, just cry out loud. And yes i did it. It is inspired from a true story of a college professor who finds an abandoned dog and he takes into his home and how the Dog sets an example to the world about loyalty. Believe me, the dog put us all humans at shame. His loyalty and emotions were far far greater and immortal than humans and this is what makes this film truly Epic. You will see many scenes proving this statement in the film. Lasse Halstrom wherever you are just take my salute and please recieve my thank you, it means a lot to me. The way you crafted this film has left me stunned and heart broken. I promise you here that sooner or later i will have a Pet and i hope it would love me just the way Hachi loved his owner.

The closest word which comes to my mind in this case is 'stupendous'.Hachiko is a true story about a dog in Japan and the special bond he shared with a professor whom he met when it was a little puppy. The story has been put forward exceptionally well by the cast and the director.The movie has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes, yet remarkably you are kept spellbound after a couple of minutes into the movie. And as the other reviews suggest, making the whole theater grab onto their tissues explains how good it really is.Lastly, coming for someone who also rates 'Eight below' as one of his favorite's, a high rating of Hachiko would seem a little biased to many. But in my honest opinion I don't think that anybody who has watched this movie can rate it below 10.",

Well my journey is also coming at an end. My heart isn't just into anything anymore.This is my last review and from the title you can see that it is dedicated to a little kitten. A stray cat had taken residence in our home and had given birth to a pair of beautiful kittens. One died after catching a viral infection. We rescued the mother and surviving kitten who had also succumbed to the infection. I am pleased to note that mother and kitten are safe and sound and the mother cat is pregnant again.Back to this review. It is the true story of a professor who adopts a puppy(Hachiko) and it grows to become a faithful dog that waited for his master at a train station when he left for work until he came back. One day the professor died from a heart attack and the dog did not know this fact. The dog still waited for his master for the next 9 years, 9 months and 15 days till his death. The original Hachiko Monogatari is a 1987 Japanese drama film directed by Seijiro Koyama and starring Tatsuya Nakadai, Kaoru Yachigusa, Mako Ishino and Masumi Harukawa. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the 2009 modern remake and stars veteran actor Richard Gere in the role of the professor(Parker Wilson). The story is basically the same with minor changes to the script to adapt to the American version. Richard Gere is such a wonderful warm and loving actor. You should see An Officer And A Gentleman(1982), considered his best film. His acting in the film is professional as always. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa(Kickboxer 2, Showdown in Little Tokyo, Mortal Kombat) and Joan Allen(Manhunter, Face/Off) have small supporting roles.

                "I have watched some touching and moving movies in my lifetime and about 2 movies have made me cry, However i was crying my eyes out when i was watching this Hachiko movie. I was crying for a good 10 -15 minutes even after this movie ended. I have browsed through the comments and reviews on this IMDb board and on other online forums and have noticed that so many other people who watched this movie have also cried. I really think NO OTHER MOVIE has made so many people cry. Whenever i saw Hachiko go to the station and sit there waiting oblivious to the fact his owner died, my heart died a little each time.Knowing that this movie was actually based on a real life story set in the 1920s-1930s in Tokyo whereby an Akita-breed dog waited in front of the Shibuya train station day by day around the same time at the same spot for NINE WHOLE YEARS for his beloved university professor Professor Ueno to come back from work, really breaks my heart.No animal or human would ever sit in front of the station to wait for someone they love for THIS LONG (9 FREAKING YEARS). This dog Hachiko must have had such ENORMOUS love for his owner that he would throw his life away (9 years is like 7 decades in dog years) waiting in front of the station at the RIGHT TIME each day.How clever are dogs? Real-life Hachiko somehow knew how to read the time in order to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years. Waiting for 9 years- wow! I never knew that the extent of an animal's LOVE and DEDICATION and PERSISTENCE could reach those heights.In real life, Hachiko's was given away after his master's death, but he routinely escaped, showing up again and again at his old home. This showed that Hachiko loved his original owners (Ueno and his wife and kids) too much to let go of his master Ueno or his memory of him and wanted to return to his remaining living owners.Eventually, Hachiko's apparently realized that his Professor Ueno no longer lived at the house. So he went to look for his master at the train station where he had accompanied him so many times before. How smart and clever is that of a dog? The other original owners of Hachiko had moved to a different location and Hachiko could not find his other living original owners since he is a dog and so he decided to wait in front of the railway station like he always used to do for his master to turn up and be reunited with him,This real life story of Hachiko clearly demonstrated UNDYING, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR ANOTHER since both the PHYSICAL ABSENCE of his owner Professor Ueno and the PASSING OF TIME would not diminish Hachiko's love and UNFLINCHING LOYALTY for his original master Ueno. This real life story also reminds us about HOW LOVE CAN MAKE ANYONE (INCLUDING ANIMALS AND DOGS) do CRAZY THINGS for someone they love.Somehow I just wished that in real-life, the wife and family of Professor Ueno should have just placed lifeless body of Professor Ueno on the floor for a while for Hachiko to sniff and inspect the body. This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead.I am quite sure that Hachiko, being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years, would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE, then he would not have to wait for 9 years.You can read up on the real life story of Hachiko in this Wikipedia page which also lists all the Japanese films made about Hachiko.

                "\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" is a remake of a Japanese film, \"Hachi-Ko\" (1987). Oddly, however, this American version keeps SOME of the original Japanese story (such as the breed of dog, the dog's name and SOME of the events in the dog's life) and completely changes so much--especially since \"Hachi-Ko\" is based on a real life Japanese occurrence, not in America. Back in the 1920s and 30s, the real Hachi was a dog owned by a Japanese professor. One thing that set him apart from most dogs was that Hachi would meet the professor at the train station after work each day! But, even more unusual is that after the professor's death, Hachi CONTINUED this routine--waiting patiently for his master every day! In many ways, the story is like that of the very famous Scottish dog, Greyfriars Bobby--who is memorialized in Edinburgh outside the pub and church where the do would do its daily ritual (lying at his master's grave and then visiting the pub). In fact, I did some reading and found several other similar accounts throughout the world. This leads me to wonder WHY the film did a semi-remake. Why not just make a fictionalized story? Why keep a few details and change others--especially when this Japanese dog inexplicably shows up in Rhode Island!So does this lack of attention to detail mean I hate the film? Even as a retired history teacher, I cannot, as I must confess that I've owned dogs for years and currently have two massive hairy beasts who adore me (in addition to my two cats who alternate between adoration and ambivalence). I am a sucker for a film about a cute dog--and the Hachi in the movie is one of the cutest Akita's ever (much cuter, by the way, than the original Hachi). You cannot help but like the dog and enjoy seeing him interact with his owner (Richard Gere). But, there needs to be more than a cute dog to make a really good film--and currently this fame has an astonishingly high score of 8.2! Is this number, at least in part, less about the quality of the production and more a vote to signify that most everyone loves cute dogs? Well, yes. Objectively speaking, the film is a remake--and that's one strike against it at the onset. And, I just cannot imagine a pleasant doggy film making it to the IMDb's Top 250 List--but it did and it's currently #190--giving it a slightly higher rating than films like \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (one of the greatest films of the 1940s), \"Rocky\" (the first one was very nice), \"A Fistful of Dollars\" and \"The Celebration\"--as well as the original Japanese film!! Overall, it's a nice doggy film that is VERY family-friendly at that and with a lovely and evocative piano soundtrack. By all means watch it-- but don't be surprised if you like it but don't love it.A few final notes: First, I noticed that AFTER the master died in this American adaptation, it ALWAYS seemed to be snowing in this town--for years and years after the death! Second, what's with the professor's wife?! Her husband dies and she finds Hachi at the end years later at the train station and is surprised to see him?! Where was she at the time...off-world or taking a very long nap?! Didn't someone bother to tell her about HER dog or didn't she ask about how old Hachi was doing?!

I still keep thinking about the story and every time when I think about it, I felt sad and so sorry for both the Prof and the dog, I am sure this is a film I won't forget ... the soundtrack is another praise.., definitely a classic for Richard Gere.. Although the movie centered on the bond/love between Hachi and his human parent, this is also a story about love between spouse, love between friends, father-daughter love and most of all, a close knit community of people with a big heart...My favourite scene is where Mrs Wilson come back to town after 10 years and found Hachi still waiting, so touching I can't control my tears... the closing scene is just devastating, Hachi died still dreaming of his master coming out of the train station.....This is a must see movie for every dog lovers. For human, dogs may just be a part of our life, but for the dog(s), we are everything they got. Again, Richard Gere is just superb and natural, so did Joan Allen. And lastly the dogs are so cute and adorable.A truly remarkable wait - 10 years... words failed to describe the amount of love, devotion and loyalty Hachi had for Parker...",

        "synopsis": "Before the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, the stars of a theater company in Warsaw are the \"ham\" actor Josef Tura (Jack Benny) and his beautiful wife, Maria (Carole Lombard). As part of the company's rehearsal of \"Gestapo\", a play satirizing the Nazis, one of the actors, Bronski (Tom Dugan), takes to the street to prove that he looks like Hitler in his costume and makeup. People gawk at the appearance of the Nazi dictator in Warsaw, until a young girl asks for the autograph of \"Mr. Bronski.\"\nThat night, when the company is performing Shakespeare's Hamlet, with Tura in the title role, Bronski commiserates with his friend and colleague, Greenberg (Felix Bressart), about being limited to being spear carriers. Greenberg, who is Jewish, reveals that it has always been his dream to perform Shylock in Merchant of Venice, especially the famous \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" speech.\nMeanwhile, Maria has received a bouquet of flowers from the handsome young pilot Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). She arranges to meet him, telling Sobinski to come to her dressing room when Tura begins his \"To be or not to be...\" speech, so they can be sure of privacy. The young man walks out, very obviously, when Tura begins his monologue, causing the highly-strung actor great distress. Shortly thereafter, the company is ordered by a government representative to cancel their production of \"Gestapo\" out of fear it would offend the Germans and upset the tensions between the two nations.\nThe next night, after a brief (and chaste) assignation, Sobinski again walks out during \"To be or not to be\", freshly infuriating Tura. Sobinski returns backstage to confess his love to Maria, assuming that she will leave her husband and the stage to be with him. Before she can correct his assumption, news breaks out that Germany has invaded Poland. Sobinski leaves to join the fight, and the actors huddle in the basement of the theater as Warsaw is decimated by bombings.\nHitler conquers Poland, and the Polish division of the British Royal Air Force is fighting to free its mother country. Lt. Sobinski and other young pilots of the division sing together, with the Polish resistance leader Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges) as their guest. Siletsky hints he will return to Warsaw soon, and the men jump to give him messages for their relatives, but Sobinski is suspicious when he gives Siletsky a message for Maria Tura and he doesn't know who the famous actress is. When Sobinski reports the incident to higher authorities, they realize that Siletsky now has a list of the names and addresses of relatives of Polish airmen in the RAF, against whom reprisals can be taken.\nSobinski is sent to Warsaw to warn the resistance, but Siletsky gets there before him. The flier manages to reach Maria, who passes on the message to the underground. Immediately after, she is stopped by two soldiers, who have been ordered by Siletsky to bring her to him so he can deliver Sobinski's message and determine what \"To be or not to be\" means to her. Siletsky invites Maria to dinner, hoping to recruit her as a spy, as well as to sample her charms. She pretends to be interested and goes home to dress more appropriately for the occasion. Just before she arrives at her apartment, Tura returns and finds Sobinski in his bed and his bathrobe. Maria and Sobinski try to figure out what to do about Siletsky, while Tura tries to figure out what is going on with his wife and the pilot. In the end, Tura proclaims that he will kill Siletsky.\nLater that evening, Maria returns to Siletsky's room and pretends to be attracted to him. Just as they kiss, there is a knock at the door. A Nazi officer actually one of the members of the acting company summons Siletsky to \"Gestapo headquarters\", which is the theatre, hastily disguised with props and costumes from their play.\nTura pretends to be Col. Ehrhardt of the Gestapo, and Siletsky gives him the report containing the names and addresses of the families of the Polish pilots. He also reveals that Sobinski gave him a message for Maria, and that \"To be or not to be\" was the signal for their rendezvous. Tura reacts in an extremely jealous way and declares he will have Maria arrested. Noting this overreaction, Siletsky quickly sees that he has been duped, pulls a gun on Tura and tries to escape, but is shot and killed by Sobinski. Tura returns to the hotel disguised as Siletsky in a fake beard and glasses, to destroy the copy of the information about the Polish resistance that Siletsky has in his trunk and to confront Maria about her affair. Unfortunately, he's met at the hotel by the real Col. Ehrhardt's adjutant, Capt. Schultz (Henry Victor), and taken to meet Ehrhardt himself (Sig Ruman). Tura manages to pass himself off as Siletsky, defuses the information by naming recently executed prisoners as the leaders of the resistance, and learns that Hitler himself will visit Warsaw the next day.\nThe next day, the real Siletsky's body is discovered in the theater. Ehrhardt sends for Maria to tell her, but she is unable to warn Tura in time, and he arranges another meeting with Ehrhardt, again posing as Siletsky. When Tura arrives, Ehrhardt sends him into a room with Siletsky's dead body, hoping to frighten him into a confession. Thinking quickly, Tura shaves off Siletsky's beard and then attaches a spare fake beard that he was carrying in his pocket. He then calls Ehrhardt into the room and manipulates him into pulling Siletsky's now-fake beard off. This appears to prove that the real Siletsky was actually the imposter, but just as Tura is about to make his escape, the other actors, sent by Maria and again in Nazi costume, storm into Ehrhardt's office, yank off Tura's false beard and pretend to drag him away to prison. This gets Tura out of Gestapo headquarters, but now he cannot leave the country on the plane Ehrhardt had arranged for him, and it's only a matter of time before the ruse is discovered.\nThe company now comes up with a bold plan. The Nazis stage a show at the theater to honor Hitler, and Sobinski, Tura, Bronski and the other actors sneak in dressed as Nazis. The actors hide until Hitler arrives and takes his seat, and then, as the Nazis are singing the German national anthem inside, Greenberg suddenly appears and rushes the box. This distracts the F\u00fchrer's guards long enough for Bronski, now wearing a Hitler mustache, to emerge unnoticed from hiding, surrounded by his entourage of actors dressed as Nazi officers.\nPlaying the head of Hitler's guard, Tura demands to know what Greenberg wants, and the actor finally gets his chance to deliver Shylock's famous speech from The Merchant of Venice. He ends with a ringing \"if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?!\" and Tura orders his \"officers\" to take Greenberg away. He also recommends that Bronski/Hitler leave Poland immediately, and all the actors march out, get in Hitler's cars and drive away.\nBack at her apartment, Maria is waiting for the actors to pick her up. They all intend to leave on Hitler's plane, but Col. Ehrhardt shows up and tries to seduce her. Ehrhardt is amazed, however, when the door opens and Bronski walks in disguised as Hitler. Bronski simply turns and walks out in silence, but Ehrhardt immediately thinks that Maria is having an affair with Hitler and he has just been caught trying to steal the F\u00fchrer's mistress. Maria dashes after Bronski calling, \"Mein F\u00fchrer, Mein F\u00fchrer!\"\nAll the actors take off in the plane. They easily dispose of the Nazi pilots, and Sobinski flies the plane to Scotland, where the actors are interviewed by the press. Asked what reward he'd like for his service to the Allies, Tura hesitates in a show of false modesty, but Maria quickly responds for him, \"He wants to play Hamlet.\"\nIn the final scene, Tura is now once again on stage at a theater in London as Hamlet and reaches the moment of \"To be or not to be.\" He sees Sobinski in the audience as he begins the speech, but both are amazed when a new young officer gets up and noisily heads backstage.",

                "A number of interest points here. A brilliant premise. Material that was daring at the time, that one is amazed at what it got away with even if some of it may be an acquired taste. That it was the final film of the lovely Carole Lombard, who died far too young in a plane crash not long after with much more to give. And that it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch, a personal favourite of mine who had one of the most distinctive directing styles for any director often cited as \"the Lubtisch touch\".Found 'To Be or Not to Be' a truly fabulous film, have seen many very good to masterpiece films recently (as well as inevitably some duds) and this stands out among the very best of them. What could easily have been tasteless and offensive, with what it was satirising and considering the time, turned out to be one of the funniest comedies seen recently and ever actually and wartime comedies have seldom been funnier or more original. It also contains some of the best work of all involved. In front of and behind the camera, am aware that sounds very cliched but to me it's true.'To Be or Not to Be' looks great, immaculately yet atmospherically designed with a real sense of period and beautifully shot without being too glamorous. The music is neither too jaunty or low key, while Lubitsch's direction is one of 'To Be or Not to Be's' biggest stars in its sophisticated style that one can recognise from anywhere.Regarding the script, it is intricate and full of sharp wit and hilariously quotable lines that as mentioned above in my first paragraph when talking about the material being daring. The opening gag is hysterical and one that one does not expect, while the running joke concerning Robert Stack as Maria's (played by Lombard) admirer is an example of a running joke that doesn't get old prematurely and doesn't get repetitive, dangers with running jokes. 'To Be or Not to Be' is not just non-stop hilarity though, there is also surprising pathos that one doesn't always get in comedy and is genuinely poignant. Affectionate and inspiring are further things to describe and never had any problem with the pace.Lubitsch's direction is one of two particularly wonderful things about 'To Be or Not to Be'. The other is the simply sublime cast, showing Jack Benny at his funniest and Lombard being an absolute joy in all senses (found her touching too but a lot of it was to do with it being her final film and what a talent she was). Stack is amusing and charming and Stanley Ridges and Sig Ruman are great fun.Altogether, fabulous. Even in films that fit in the \"loved it\" category, improvements can be pointed out in order to be balanced, but in the case of 'To Be or Not to Be' there is nothing to fault. 10/10",

                "Comedies rarely stand the test of time - this one does: one of the funniest films I have ever seen.When I was 16 (20 years ago, sigh...), this was re-released for a short time in a local art-house cinema, and my father insisted I go watching it with a friend. Well, teenagers don't normally line up to see 50 year old black and white comedies, but - man, was I glad I did!This is a pitch black comedy that feels as fresh today as it must have then; in fact, this must have been kind of a shock in 1942. There are no cheesy clean characters or cringe-worthy lines: this is a firework of fast, witty dialogue with an edge and the sexiest, cleverest (and most morally ambiguous) female protagonist I have ever seen in a film before the \"New Hollywod\" era.Even the structure and the way the story evolves are very modern; there are flashbacks and twists and turns that might be very common in contemporary films but must have seemed almost \"avant-garde\" at the time.The biggest fun, of course, is how Lubitsch takes the pi** out of Hitler's blind, fanatic followers. I don't believe the Nazis have ever been mocked better than in this comedy masterpiece (and I only hope old Adolf has seen it, too). Mel Brooks' remake is not bad, but the original is simply killer. See it, and then see it again (and again).Priceless. 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

                "In celebrating the 75th anniversary of the release of Casablanca, it is easy to overlook another anti-Nazi film, Ernst Lubitsch's \"screwball\" comedy To Be or Not To Be, a film that skewered the Nazi cause with equal effectiveness. While not as dramatic or filled with memorable lines and patriotic songs, To Be or Not To Be, like Casablanca, the film features two main Hollywood stars, Carole Lombard and Jack Benny and a love triangle in which romance must be subordinate to a greater cause. Set in Poland just before the German invasion of September 1, 1939, the film opens as a mustachioed man bearing a close resemblance to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler is seen walking alone in the streets of Warsaw.This Hitler, however, turns out to be the actor Bronski (Tom Dugan), a bit-player impersonating the Fuhrer in a play being put on by a Polish theatrical group. Is Hitler \"by any chance interested in Mr. Maslowski's delicatessen?\" teases the narrator in the opening segment. \"That's impossible\u2014he's a vegetarian!\" Responding to all the \"Heil Hitler\" salutes, Bronski asserts \"Heil myself\" as he walks through an open door. Bronski is playing a secondary role to the famous Polish actor Josef Tura, played by Jack Benny, then a radio star whose trademark straight face and deadpan humor marks the film.Tura's wife Maria, also a popular Polish actress, is played by Carole Lombard who was to meet a shocking death in a plane crash in January, 1942 shortly after the film was completed. In the film, Maria is two-timing her actor husband by romancing a young flyer Lt. Sobinski (Robert Stack) who falls \"head over heels\" for the actress. The running gag in the film is that whenever Josef is playing Hamlet and delivers the line, \"to be or not to be,\" it is a signal for Sobinski to get up from his seat in the theater and go backstage to meet Maria in her dressing room. It appears that Tura is more upset about his speech being interrupted than what happens behind the curtain.The sudden Nazi invasion, however, puts all romantic trysts on the back burner and the mood shifts to solemn. The plot now becomes more involved with espionage and patriotism than acting when Sobinski, now a pilot for the Royal Air Force, discovers that respected Polish professor Siletski (Stanley Ridges) is a double-agent working for the Nazis. When the Lieutenant returns to Warsaw to eliminate the traitorous professor, Maria and Josef team up to help by launching an elaborate charade to trick the unsuspecting Nazis. While the film takes its name from the famous line in Hamlet, Shylock's monologue from the Merchant of Venice, spoken in front of Nazi swastikas, is recited by Jewish actor Felix Bressart, \"Have we not eyes? Have we not hands, organs, senses, dimensions, attachments, passions?\" he asks the Nazis, \"If you poison us, do we not die?\" It is a noteworthy plea for tolerance in the days of rabid anti-Semitism even though the line \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" is not spoken. According to Thomas Doherty writing in Tablet magazine, \"the word \"Jew\" was seldom heard on the Hollywood screen, even in war-minded scenarios where the topic of anti-Semitism was front and center.\" He also quotes film historian Lester D. Friedman saying that \"The studio bosses were always\u2014even at this point\u2014afraid of thrusting Jews into the spotlight.\" Whatever the reason, To Be or Not to Be is marked with the genius of one man, the great Jewish director Ernst Lubitsch who said, \"What I have satirized in this picture are the Nazis and their ridiculous ideology,\" and that the tone and temper of the film \"cannot leave any doubt in the spectator's mind what my point of view and attitude are toward these acts of horror.\" While the film is a broad and biting satire, from the beginning of production in November 1941 to its completion on December 24th, however, events made sure that To Be or Not to Be, as well as Charles Chaplin's The Great Dictator, was no longer a laughing matter.",

                "As Adolf Hitler starts ravaging Europe, a polish theatrical Nazi-satire is cancelled, the day of the very first performance. Nevertheless, while Poland is invaded by the Nazi army, the same theatrical team, with the same German soldier costumes, will deliver the best play of their entire career in order to thwart the actions of a spy.This cinematographic gem directed by Ernst Lubitsch is built on a solid script, exquisite dialogues, and outstanding actors, especially Jack Benny, Carole Lombard and Sig Ruman. For obvious reasons, this indecent movie was initially coldly received: a comedy about world war II during world war II. This bitterness and/or bewilderment probably explains the blatant lack of nominations to the main Oscar categories. However, nowadays, we only remember the genius.In bulk, ones of my favorite quotes: May I have your autograph, Mr Bronski? So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt? To be or not to be. If we should ever have a baby, I'm not so sure I'd be the mother. They named a brandy after Napoleon, they made a herring out of Bismarck, and the Fuhrer is going to end up as a piece of cheese! Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg? Hey, wait a minute, you go to the hotel and I'll cross my fingers. I'm a good Pole and I love my country and I love my slippers.

                "\"To Be or Not To Be\" doesn't trivialize the barbarity of the Nazi regime as much as it ennobles art and gives an aura of metaphysical importance to laughter, as the main characteristic of the reasonable person. It's precisely because Ernst Lubitsch could laugh at the Nazism that one shouldn't underestimate the sadness and terror that devoured his soul. One could say the same about Chaplin's \"Great Dictator\", more focused on the inner heroism of the little people while Lubitsch' movie is a love letter to artists, and the work of a true one.Lubitsch grew up in Berlin and became an acting sensation after World War I before becoming one of the most promising directors of Hollywood. A precocious talent with a sense of sophistication that would be known as the 'Lubitsch touch', he was probably under the influence of that boost of creativity and flamboyance that made Berlin an artistic Mecca in the early 30s (like in Bob Fosse's \"Cabaret\"). His film opens on Warsaw, a more suitable place for free art once Germany surrendered to swastikas. And as if he anticipated the criticism over his subject, the story features a play named \"The Gestapo\" and satirizing the Nazis. During a rehearsal, the man playing Hitler (Irish actor Tom Dugan) delivers a hilarious and unexpected \"Heil myself\". The line gets cut by the director who makes it a matter of ethics not to make Nazis funny, much to the actor's reluctance.Basically, Lubitsch asks us the question: should we sacrifice a good line for the sake of seeming decency? How many times haven't we felt the necessity to cross the barrier of good taste because it was so tempting. So the line is censored because of the risk of offending Hitler and when the Germans come on a day of September 1939, the play is cancelled once and for all. The situation resonates like Churchill's parable about war and dishonour, fearing the Nazis is the dishonourable attitude, even when meant to play safe, you're never safe with them, so let's just use your best weapon, guns or gags it doesn't matter. While I was wondering if Lubitsch would have been as loose on the Nazis if he knew about the Camps, I was hiding a chuckle because the line \"so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt\" kept springing to my mind. Should I feel guilty?No less than for any movie that dared to turn the subject into laughing matter, from Donald Duck's \"Der Fuerher's Face\" to \"La Vita e Bella\". It's because Nazis were human that their crimes were horrific, it's because they were human that they should be mocked. Art is the triumph of the intellect over the brutal force, the sensitivity over cynicism, it can be sophisticated and fancy but it can't really do without powerful sentiments, this is why the film makes a good use of Shakespeare's lines (borrowed from \"Hamlet\" and \"The Merchant of Venice\") and even more why it focuses on a married couple, the greatest actress of Poland Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) and her hammy husband Joseph (Jack Benny). The film opens with a sort of vaudevillian mood where Maria exploits her husband's \"Hamlet\" soliloquy to bring the handsome aviator Sobinski (Robert Starck) to her room, the running gag is not overused so Marie doesn't appear too cheap and Joseph too dumb.There's a fine balance between the romance and the screwball situations and they all get along with the intricacies of a plot that involves a sinister but seductive spy named Professor Siletski (Stanley Ridges), who proposes Maria to become an agent. Meanwhile, the troop must absolutely capture the man, confiscate the documents that contain names of Polish Resistant members and get rid of the spy, and this is where their Nazi costumes get quite handy. So we see Jack benny and all his friends impersonating Nazi officers and even Selitski with variable effects, sometimes with the right timing, sometimes a delay force them to rewrite the script. In a sort of meta-referential nod to his own art, Lubitsch directs actors playing directors, actors and writers, proving that sometimes a good act can be a matter of life and death. Hammy too much and your cover is blown if not your head. Maria proves to be a more restrained actress so she can dodge the Nazis' flair, same can't be said about Joseph and Benny's antics endanger the film's credibility in their exaggerated audacity, the man pushes his luck so often it's a wonder how he did survive.The film also suffers from a series of contrivances that happen all too conveniently near the end leading to a rushed climax only redeemed by the hilarious ending. Still, the real black spot in the film's legacy is of course the haunting of Carole Lombard's memory. The actress died in a plane crash a few weeks after the film's release, the USA had just entered the war and she was collecting bonds during a tour across America. In a way, she was a victim of that war though she lived far from the ruins and ashes of Poland, her death cut one of the most promising careers short and made Gable so inconsolable he joined the war too... I avoided that film for a long time because of that story, it had saddened me a lot even more because I happen to be afraid of flying.I couldn't believe how many times she referred to flights during the film, the simple fact that she loved an aviator gives it an eerie feeling, it's just as if the film was doomed to be clouded by tragedy, individual and universal. However, and that might be the secret of \"To Be or Not to Be\", It's all fiction, it's not reality, the film was criticized when the war was still raging and now it's a classic, once reality is as dead as fiction, what remains is the essence of art.as",

                "Joseph Tura and his wife are part of an actors troop in pre-WW2 Poland. When a handsome young pilot is forced to break off his affair with Mrs Tura to go to England and join the RAF, he sends a message through an English agent who offers to take messages to families of all the pilots when he goes to Poland.  Realising too late that Professor Siletsky is a double agent taking addresses to the Nazi's, Lt Sobinski alerts Tura who is forced to play several roles to try and outwit the Nazi's and protect the underground resistance.Despite having heard it mentioned (and avoided the remake) I had still never seen this film until earlier today.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I knew that it had been made during the war and that it's humour might not seem as mocking or sharp today.  However I was surprised how funny it actually was while it also dealt with the Nazi issue at the same time.  The mocking tone of the film is balanced nicely by a real vein of wit with sharp word play all around.  The plot is kept ticking over by this humour until Tura is able to drive the film by his many performances!The Nazi's are mocked without taking away from the horrors of what they were.  The cast are what really makes the film work for me though.  Although he takes second billing, I can't help but feel that Benny is the star of the film as he has all the best characters and the lion's share of the lines. Lombard does very well indeed and shows a real ability for quick witty lines \u0096 the fact that she died in a plane crash leaving this her last movie should be considered a great loss.  The whole support cast, whether Polish actor or German commander, all play very well managing to bring both wit and pathos to the film.Overall a film that is not as uncomfortable to watch as I suspected it might have been, in fact one that is downright hilarious at times and has all the sharpness and wit that I want in a comedy.

                "There is a famous review of this film by the late Sunday Times critic, Dilys Powell which begins 'Is the joke funny?'... what Miss Powell was getting at was that, given the horror of the Holocaust, it is appropriate to laugh at the Nazis. The answer is, ultimately, irrelevant to the viewing of this modest masterpiece.Lubitsch was, by this time, coming to the end of an exquisite career that defined the nature of sophistication in 'light' cinema. 'To Be or Not To Be' skips lightly over all of the minefield of a subject like this and it is difficult or impossible to think of any other filmmaker who might have managed it (if you look at Mel Brooks' limp remake, you can see why).In 1996, I presented a massive season of 'the greatest' films in Belfast for the centenary of cinema - 250 titles in 9 months. Of all of them, this was the film which got the greatest ovation - about 5 minutes with a nearly full house standing and applauding! They may have applauded for many reasons, but here are certainly some of them...The very complicated narrative is presented virtually flawlessly and the comedy is never allowed to hold up the narrative. The principle actors - Carole Lombard (breathtakingly beautiful) and Jack Benny in particular, but many of the supporting cast as well - throw themselves into the affair with a gusto that is completely infectious. Apart from the satirical aspect of the story and the way in which Hitler and the Nazis are mercilessly ridiculed for their authoritarianism and the fear which is their only motivator, the film pokes gentle fun at the vanity of actors in a warm and happy manner. Finally, and most important, is the notion of farce. Farce rarely works in the cinema, but here it does, and in the grand manner - just look at how many times the situation regarding Professor Siletsky changes profoundly during the film - it is dizzying - yet the characters manage to come up with (often self-defeating or inappropriate) schemes on every occasion.This is a wonderful work that, I have no hesitation in saying, is absolutely vital for anyone who wants to really understand the glory of the cinema. But to answer Dilys Powell's question... yes, the joke is deliriously funny.",

                "I was genuinely shocked when the movie began to see Jack Benny in a Nazi uniform and thought how inappropriate that casting decision was, right until it was revealed he was taking part in a documentary on Nazi Germany. So with a sigh of relief, I settled back to enjoy this humorous treatment with Carole Lombard portraying Benny's wife as the couple, Joseph and Maria Tura, became part of the Polish underground in 1939 Warsaw, right on the brink of World War II. I always wonder how films like this might have been received by audiences of the time, realizing that war was imminent, and whether or not the viewing public had reservations about seeing a film treating such a serious topic with humor. In director Ernst Lubitsch's case, he handled the issue with a unique balance of political satire, romance, slapstick and wartime suspense, and if anything, the picture might be even better received today than back in the era in which it was made.Third billed in the film is Robert Stack as a Polish soldier infatuated with Maria Tura, thereby creating a bit of tension for Jack Benny's character in the early going. This situation ultimately turns to naught as Benny assumes a variety of impersonations to foil messages being carried by a German spy to Nazi headquarters. I was a fan of Jack Benny, mostly during his 1950's television show era, and it's uncanny how he affects so many of his typical stage gestures and mannerisms as an actor, along with the recognizable speech pattern. Not to mention the way he obsesses over his 'greatness' as an actor, another aspect of his comic persona. As someone of Polish descent myself, I kept a watchful eye on all of the English to Polish translations utilized in the film and they were handled pretty well. Things like notices at the Polish Theater and gender postings on the restroom doors. I only mention that because I got the biggest kick out of being able to read them. The picture probably could have thrown in a few standard colloquialisms to good effect, but I didn't notice any.If you like this film's subject matter, that is, a mocking comic treatment of the wartime Nazi regime, you might also look up another film from 1942 that takes place on American soil. It's called \"All Through the Night\", and has a cast headed by Humphrey Bogart and Conrad Veidt, dealing with Broadway gamblers who turn patriotic when they stumble onto a cell of Nazi saboteurs. It's about as silly a story as this one, but with a great supporting cast that includes Peter Lorre, Phil Silvers and Jackie Gleason.",

                "It has long been controversial to make a comedy out of war and tragedy, but often it is among the best ways of dealing with a difficult subject. Being able to satirize evil and imagine humour even in the most desperate of plights is a big part of coming to terms with these things. And when done in the right way, it can make some of the most compelling works that cinema has to offer. With To Be or Not to Be, director Ernst Lubitsch, who had spent most of his career making sophisticated and often innuendo-laden comedies with absolutely no political content, surprised everyone by tackling the most urgent of topical issues head-on, yet still maintaining the frivolous comedy style that was his forte.Co-written with Melchior Lengyel (who had provided Lubitsch with his earlier hit Ninotchka) To Be or Not to Be features a brilliant premise \u2013 that of actors turning their skills to do underground work. As such it takes a light-hearted yet affectionate view of stage acting (which is where Lubitsch started out). This was a rather timely subject in Hollywood at the time. In the early days of sound, a lot of theatre actors had been called in to do the talkie business, but now the trend was shifting towards subtler, more naturalistic performances, as especially encouraged by directors like William Wyler and George Stevens. And there's nothing wrong with that approach \u2013 Wyler and Stevens were making some excellent pictures \u2013 but as a result the good old ham actor was becoming a somewhat marginalised figure. To Be or Not to Be makes the theatrical scenery-chewers into the heroes. The debate between the different styles is itself the subject of many of the gags, for example Lionel Atwill continually having to be reminded not to overact. The young Polish airman who woos Lombard is named Stanislaw, perhaps after Stanislavski, the nemesis of ham actors.The casting of To Be or Not to Be is like a celebration of the little hams. You won't find theatrical legends like Charles Laughton or John Barrymore here, but supporting players like Atwill, Felix Bressart and Tom Dugan are exactly the sort of people who were now a dying breed in the Hollywood movie. Here they can be seen at their unashamed best. The two leads on the other hand are not hams at all, but they were among the best comedy actors of the era. Jack Benny was ironically a master at underplaying scenes, often at his funniest when doing very little, such as drawing out the pause before beginning Hamlet's soliloquy. Carole Lombard was a consummate comedienne, often adopting a tone of complete sincerity that made little throwaway lines (like her enraptured \"It certainly does (interest me)\" when Robert Stack is talking about his bomber) sound comically ridiculous. But she could turn that sincerity to dramatic purpose as well, for example her very genuine look of trepidation when she is questioned trying to leave the hotel.And finally let us talk of Lubitsch himself. There isn't much to say about Lubitsch's direction here that I haven't said in one of my many other reviews of his pictures. One thing that is specifically worth mentioning now though is the attention Lubitsch gives to minor performers. Another feature of the more modern directors is that they gave very little screen time to bit players. The aforementioned Wyler would often get supporting players to do their scenes with their backs to the camera so as not to draw attention from the leads. Again this is not intended as a criticism \u2013 it is right for Wyler's dramas. But Lubitsch was one director who always found a little bit of camera time for even the most inconsequential of actors. There are obvious examples in To Be or Not to Be with the many members of the acting troupe, but notice how in the scene with the Polish aviators in Britain, he treats several of them to close-ups. These aren't \"face-in-the-crowd\" close-ups that you might see in a montage. Instead it's as if each of these men has become a lead character for a few seconds, even though they will soon disappear from the story. But Lubitsch did not do this indiscriminately. In the scene where Lombard passes on the photograph at the bookstore, there are two Nazis in the background. We don't catch a glimpse of their faces, we just have to know that they exist. It seems that when Lubitsch lingers on a character's face he does so out of affection. And that is really the attitude that permeates To Be or Not to Be \u2013 contempt for the villains, affection for the heroes, even through all the wit and satire. It is this ideal that really makes that fusing of the tragic and the comic work.",

                "In 1940 the American public was shocked when Charlie Chaplin released his first all talkie movie THE GREAT DICTATOR, in which he lampooned Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Despite the new European war, we were yet still at peace with both Axis states. Hollywood, with rare exceptions (BLOCKADE, CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY, ESCAPE) had been gingerly tackling the Nazis and Fascists. Yet public reaction to THE GREAT DICTATOR was odd. It had a big box office success, and yet many were appalled because it chose to say Hitler could be laughed at. Chaplin's response was that if he had been laughed at to begin with he would never have become such a threat.Actually other voices were beginning to stir in Hollywood. One was the great comedy director Ernst Lubitsch, who poked an occasional jab at the Nazis. Lubitsch had to wait until 1941 for a full assault on the Nazis - TO BE OR NOT TO BE, a film that looked at the German invasion of Poland, and it's occupation of Warsaw. It had an interesting cast. The lead went to Carole Lombard, who had many comedy performances under her belt. She played Maria Tura, the leading lady (and wife) of \"that great actor\" (as he always prefaces his remarks) Joseph Tura. Joseph is Jack Benny.Of all the leading men in her career, Lombard never played opposite one who was really more of a star in a different medium. Typical co-stars for Lombard were John Barrymore, Fred MacMurray, Cary Grant, Ralph Bellamy, William Powell, Robert Montgomery, Clark Gable, and Fredric March. Here it was Benny, who while he had a string of movie credits was basically a radio comedy star (and later would be a television star). His best films (GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE, ARTISTS AND MODELS, CHARLIE'S AUNT) were not record breakers at the box office. In fact, while his performances were good in these, he did not necessarily shine in them (Laird Cregar, in one simple moment in CHARLIE'S AUNT, got the biggest laugh of the film). Nobody realized that his performance as Joseph Tura would be his best one, and that within two years he'd make his final starring fiasco in THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT.Benny and Lombard proved to work well together as the egotistical, but oddly loving couple of theater hams. In fact the actors making up the Tura company are all good, including Lionel Atwill (who briefly is seen playing Claudius to Benny's Hamlet), Felix Bressart as Greenberg (who dreams of doing the Shylock speech from THE MERCHANT OF VENICE), Tom Dugan as Bronski (who hopes to play Hitler on the stage), Charles Halton as Dubosch (the stage manager, and the head of the Warsaw underground), and Maude Eburne as Lombard's cynical maid Anna. The screenplay did give plenty of time showing the difficulties and tensions of a stage company working together, and of handling temperamental stars and their egos.While putting on a play lampooning the Nazis (whom Benny and the others dislike), the government of Poland (Frank Reicher) says that due to the growing problems with Germany the play can't be produced. So the troop put on Tura's production of HAMLET. Benny as the Prince of Denmark (giving the great soliloquy) goes through the proper steps, although knowing the comedian from Radio one expects him to start it with \"WELL!\". But he finds that a man in uniform (young Robert Stack) leaves his seat in the middle of the third aisles just as he begins, \"To be or not to be....\" He does not know (until later in the film) that Stack had arranged to do this to keep a rendezvous with Lombard in her dressing room. Subsequently he treats her to a plane flight (he is a Polish Air Force pilot). When war comes he and his fellows fight, but the survivors make it to England. The grimmest section of the film is the occupation scenes. Like the comedy in THE GREAT DICTATOR, because we know what actually happened these scenes seem slightly unreal. But in 1941/42 they still get the fears and difficulties of the occupation across. Signs of stores and streets we saw hanging normally earlier are in ruins (including a delicatessen). The theater is boarded up. Had Lubitsch wished to do a tragic film he could easily have done so. But he allows the situation to blossom into a black comedy.Stanley Ridges plays Professor Siletsky, a secret German Agent who has fooled the Allies into going back to Warsaw. He has the names of families of the pilots. Stack is sent back to Warsaw to stop him, and contacts Lombard who helps. Soon the entire theater group gets involved. But will their theatrical egos blow their anti-Nazi plans? That is the running theme of the concluding portion of the film. Also along for the ride is Sig Ruman as Col. Ehrhardt, the Gestapo Chief who relishes the name \"Concentration Camp Ehrhardt\", but who keeps running afoul of Professor Siletsky (it is the Professor, isn't it?), when he makes seemingly harmless comments about Hitler. His reaction is usually to yell for his adjutant, Schultz (Henry Victor), whose whole purpose is apparently to be there to be yelled at.The film was a great success, but the death of Carole Lombard in a plane crash a month after it was shot cast a shadow over it. Yet it was a fitting swan song for that divine comedienne's career.",

                "Beneath all the one-liners and amusing gags, this classic comedy has an undertone of satire that is quite effective. Jack Benny plays his role with just the right amount of exaggeration for it to work perfectly, and he, Carole Lombard, and the rest of the cast help Ernst Lubitsch to tell a lively yet worthwhile tale. There are a few slow spots early in the movie, but after it hits its stride, everything fits together well.Very few film-makers can make something like this succeed, because they take themselves too seriously. Lubitsch does not, and as a result this film provides a caricatured but relatively insightful portrayal of the Nazis, with a light-hearted yet appreciative look at those who opposed them in the occupied countries. The right kind of lighter touch can sometimes be more effective in commenting on important issues than the heavy, emotionally laden harangues that are all too common.While providing good entertainment, this movie also brings out the Nazis' inherent insecurity, pettiness, and short-sightedness, while also demonstrating their growing capacity for destroying the innocent. For example, the wonderful character actor Sig Ruman is greatly entertaining as a Nazi bureaucrat, yet he also cleverly brings out the pathetic side of such persons.Aside from a couple of good gags, it starts off just a little slowly. A lot of time is spent on Robert Stack's character, who is (through no fault of Stack's) not very interesting. Likewise, the subplot involving him and Lombard takes up a lot more time than it was worth. Other than that, though, it moves briskly, with many entertaining scenes while it develops the story. As the pace picks up, the members of Benny's acting troupe get some fine moments of their own, Benny himself has some fine scenes with several other characters, and everything builds up nicely towards a good finale.",

The film is a good comedy that seems to has kept some of its freshness intact.The film works because of the great contribution of Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, who sadly, died before the film had its premiere. They play the Turas, a Polish theatrical couple that foresee the Nazi invasion of their country.In fact, Jack Benny, a man associated as a comedian, first on radio, then on television, was an actor with an uncanny sense of timing. Mr. Benny was a natural for this type of comedy, as he proves in the film. His pairing with Carole Lombard was a stroke of genius. In fact, for being associated to lighter fare, he demonstrates with his take on Joseph Tura, he was an actor of stature.Carole Lombard is seen as Maria Tura, a grand dame of the Polish theater. Ms. Lombard gave a marvelous performance and her contribution to the success of this film is amazing. Robert Stack is seen as the pilot Sobinski.

                "Only Ernst Lubitsch could have balanced all of the aspects of this film and had it come out right. He satirizes the Nazis without diminishing the evil they represented, delivers a comedy amidst the light drama of a resistance movement, and adds a little element of romance besides. The timing for the film was extraordinary; while it was being shot America had not yet entered the war, and before it was released, Carole Lombard had tragically died at age 33. The film opens a troupe of Polish actors rehearsing a play satirizing the Nazis in August, 1939, a month before the invasion, and it was highly topical at the time.Lombard is simply radiant in her last film, and finds the right restraint and touch between comedy and cooing out double entendres. Jack Benny is funny in the role of her husband, a ham actor whose wife begins talking to an ardent admirer in her dressing room when he begins Hamlet's soliloquy. The other man (Robert Stack) is a Polish airman who soon sweeps them up into an effort to stop a spy within the resistance's ranks.As always Lubitsch treats his viewers with such respect, letting us connect the dots without hitting us over the head with explanations or plodding along linearly. His humor is so clever, and varies between an actor raising an eyebrow which the audience will know the meaning of, and things like the repeated line \"So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt?\". He also gets in a lot of jabs at the idiocy of the fascists, the most memorable being when two Nazis are told to jump out of a plan without parachutes and do so with a couple of Heil Hitler's and no questions asked. There are also moments that are quite touching, such as the Jewish member of the company quoting 'The Merchant of Venice' (\"If you prick us do we not bleed? If you tickle us do we not laugh? If you poison us do we not die?\").My favorite lines were the sly repartee from Carole Lombard to elude the Production Code:\nStanislav: You might not believe it, but I can drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes.\nMaria: Really?\nStanislav: Does that interest you?\nMaria: It certainly does.Siletsky: Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg?\nMaria: I prefer a slow encirclement.",

                "To Be or Not to Be is one of those great classics that can make a fan of old movies from someone who would never normally want to watch one. My brother and sister-in-law are two examples; he'll only watch something in black-and-white if forced to, and she'll fall asleep in ten minutes during any movie that doesn't star Benedict Cumberbatch. Both of them loved this movie for the simple reason that it's fantastic.You may have seen the Mel Brooks remake, but I prefer this version because it was made during the time that no one knew who was going to win the war and everyone was terrified. There's an added sense of fear and desperation in wartime movies that's absent from any other movie made after 1945. In this dark comedy, a Polish theater troupe get in over their heads after the Gestapo take over their country. Everyone in the film is frightened, and everyone who watched it at the time was frightened. And, adding a terribly tragic tone to the finished product, Carole Lombard died one month before the film's release. It's a very unique feeling to watch an actress risking her life for her country in a movie when that's exactly what she did in real life.Carole and her egotistical husband Jack Benny are the stars of a theater troupe, and when she has an affair with a young flyer, Robert Stack, their lives catapult from the stage to the warfront. Robert is involved in the Polish rebellion, and when a Nazi spy infiltrates his mission, Carole is enlisted to help save her people before the spy hands over a list of names to the Gestapo. The story itself is extremely dark and frightening, but Edwin Justus Mayer's screenplay is so clever and fast-paced, you'll find yourself laughing while you're tensely on the edge of your seat. I won't tell you what happens because it's so much fun to see it all play out, with surprises around every corner.Carole's comic timing is its usual best, and Ernst Lubitsch balances the line between comedy and drama in every scene. In the supporting cast are Sig Ruman as an incompetent Nazi Colonel who continually shifts the blame to others, Charles Halton as the theater's producer, Miles Mander, and Halliwell Hobbs. Felix Bressart is Jewish actor in the troupe, and since he was a German refugee to the United States, his lines carry an extra depth of emotion. He delivers Shylock's monologue from The Merchant of Venice three times, each time with a different meaning behind his delivery. This is an excellent film, so even if you're not usually drawn to movies made 80 years ago, give it a chance. I know you'll love it.",

                "One of the very few people who would think to remake an Ernst Lubitsch picture would be Mel Brooks who satirized just about every genre there was in Hollywood. But I doubt that Jack Benny, Carole Lombard and Robert Stack would have lent themselves to the slapstick type film that Brooks turned To Be Or Not To Be into and Mel's version is very funny.When the film opens the biggest problem that Jack Benny has on his mind is who's this secret admirer who keeps sending flowers to his wife Carole Lombard every night while they're on stage. Although it's helped his Hamlet performance, the angst Benny is feeling about Lombard being faithful, pretty soon Benny, Lombard, Polish airman Robert Stack and the whole touring company that Benny heads are all caught up in the Nazi German invasion of Poland which inaugurates World War II.Stack joins the Polish squadron of the RAF and there's a nice little Polish colony as with other occupied nations during World War II. One of them is Stanley Ridges who does propaganda broadcasts for the BBC. And he gets to be good pals with the airmen. But after he leaves for Germany on a 'secret' mission it's discovered in reality he's a German agent and is going back to Germany with a list of exiled Poles so that the Nazis could retaliate against families. Stack goes back to Poland after Ridges.Where he meets up with Lombard and Benny and the rest their troupe and let's just say that their talents as actors are never more needed than in the series of performances they give the occupying Germans.Whether dealing with marital problems or Nazis breathing down their necks Lombard, Benny, and Stack have no shortage of wits about them. Carole and Jack are old hands at comedy, but Bob Stack showed a nice gift for it as well. Of course Ernst Lubitsch's type of comedy is a great deal more sophisticated than Mel Brooks. He also was making his film at a time when the USA wasn't in the war yet and the outcome for Poland and the rest of the world remained in doubt. Not to mention what was left of a liberal spirit in Germany where Lubitsch was an exile from.This was Carole Lombard's farewell performance. Completed in 1941 To Be Or Not To Be was released just in time for Pearl Harbor and it certainly beats a lot of hastily made propaganda films that came out to tap into the national anger. It also got the same kind of knocks The Great Dictator did in satirizing the authoritarianism of the Nazis. But both films have stood the test of time. And it's not as preachy as The Great Dictator, but Lubitsch gets his point across. As for Lombard she went on a war bond tour which ended abruptly in a plane crash outside Las Vegas. FDR from the White House proclaimed she was as much a war casualty as any GI at the front and there were few who would disagree.If your taste runs to an earthier form of comedy Mel Brooks will certainly satisfy you. But for those who value sophistication as embodied in that phrase the Lubitsch touch, this To Be Or Not To Be still pulls in the laughs.",

                "This is a quite brilliant Ernst Lubitsch film which manages to skilfully combine wartime dramatic pathos with wonderfully barbed humour, without doing so in an overtly propaganda-laden way. Set in Warsaw, just before and then during the initial German occupation which itself triggered World War 2, it starts in a relatively light-hearted manner as we're introduced to an acting troupe headed by husband and wife team Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, he the hammish, self-confident leading man, she the toy-boy-chasing leading lady. When the group's latest production, topically called \"Gestapo\" is closed down for fear of reprisals by the fearful authorities, they and their company join the local resistance. Amongst the rest of the cast are two spear-carrying extras who each dream of bigger parts, one who recites Shylock's \"If you prick me do I not bleed\" speech any chance he can, the other convinced he could pass for Hitler to the general public. When these foibles are adroitly woven into the plot at a climactic stage later in the film you appreciate how well written and crafted the movie is.I've never seen Jack Benny in any other feature and only know him for his deadpan humour on American TV much later than this but he's great here as the cuckolded husband pressed into action by the Polish resistance, struggling to balance his personal life with the National Good. His timing is spot-on and really you have to wonder why movies didn't also become his medium the way they did for say Bob Hope, but if this is his one major film role, then it's certainly a memorable one. Lombard I've sometimes not appreciated in some of her other roles but she's delightful here, coquettish, but clever with it.The film shows the Polish resistance running rings round their German occupiers and also lampoons Hitler in bold fashion which surely wouldn't have been lost on wartime viewers. I loved the interwoven plotting as well as the frequent laugh-out-loud gags - right from the first humorous \"Heil Myself\" to the last \"To Be Or Not To Be\" running gag. There are only a couple of misfiring jokes like when Lombard complicity moans \"Heil Hitler\" when receiving a kiss from the Polish traitor or the too obvious \"Friends, Romans and countrymen\" line from Benny but there are far more hits than misses for sure.For me this film could have worked as a drama without the comedy and as a comedy without the drama. That's how strong both elements are here and yet put them together as well as Lubitsch does here and you have something special.About that there is no question.",

                "German-occupied Warsaw, WW2. A band of actors, headed by husband-and-wife superstars of Polish theatre, set out to prevent a German spy from revealing key members of the Polish underground and families of Polish airmen fighting in Britain.Lightly entertaining. Is a comedy-drama but doesn't entirely succeed in either area. More weighted to comedy, the comedy is largely farce, with the usual sequence of problem arises - much consternation and mad scramble for a solution - gets fixed by something that causes another problem - rinse and repeat. There are some good, even great, comedic moments but they are few and far between as the movie largely trades in cheapish gags.While predominantly a comedy, the movie had potential as a drama. There's the intrigue re the spy, the plight of the Poles in Warsaw, the general examination of war and its consequences. However, with the emphasis on comedy, these sub-plots and themes largely take a back seat. There's also a romantic angle, which just cheapens the drama.Overall, entertaining and not a bad way to spend 100 minutes, but not brilliant.",

                "This movie was made before while the US was still playin' both ends against the middle.  Makin' huge profits while staying \"neutral\" The film was not allowed to be released until after, the US entered the war. \nEasily the best of the screen versions.  The cast is tight and the timing is impeccable.  You can really tell that the cast believed in the film.  Since America had not taken a formal stance at the time this went into production the producers, cast, and crew were really making something revolutionary and controversial.  So much so that the making of this movie was not even mentioned on the Jack Benny radio program.  Which is a major deal for those familiar with Old Time Radio, Jack's film career provided excellent material for comedy writers on the radio show, but also the radio show was an excellent opportunity to promote a movie.  It is doubtful that this was a missed opportunity, what is more likely is that his sponsor or perhaps the network did not want to advocate a position.  This movie is wonderful for so many reasons.  Not only is it hilarious, there is suspense, intrigue, and history.  Another poster, mentions the Nazi's jumping out of the plane at the order of a radio transmission by Hitler.  The thing to remember here is that the Nazi army was seen as an unstoppable war machine, so efficient, that soldiers would commit suicide if asked.  This was less humor than it was to evoke fear of fascism.Everyone remembers Bob Hope and his travels during WWII, well Jack Benny and Carole Lombard were no slouches either.  After all they made this movie. Carole died in a plane crash along with her mother and twenty others returning from a war bond rally before the film was released.  Jack went where few if any cameras or radio transmitters could reach.  He could be found in the most remote parts of the world entertaining the troops.  Not to take anything from Bob, he went there as well, he just had more photo ops.Bottom line watch this movie--twice, maybe more, the dialogue is so quick and witty there is a good chance you might miss it the first time, them again it is worth at least to looks.",

                "A troupe of Polish actors, led by vain Josef Tura (Jack Benny) and his gorgeous wife Maria (Carole Lombard, in her last role before her tragic death) manage to stay one step ahead the Gestapo in Nazi occupied Warsaw. The comedy is poignant, black, and very funny (the obsequious Col. Ehrhardt and his minion Schultz are clearly antecedents of Col. Klink and Sgt. Schultz in 'Hogan's Heroes'). The entire cast is excellent as is the script, which manages to sneak some loaded innuendos past the post-code censors, and the story is complex and clever (although a few conveniences and implausibilites need be forgiven). The film was made just before the Americans entered the war and several years before the true horrors of the Nazi regime became known outside of the occupied territories; nevertheless, making a comedy about the occupation of Poland must have taken some chutzpah (similar to Chaplin's lampooning of Der Fuhrer in 1940's 'The Great Dictator'). Although the word is never used, the actor Greenberg (Felix Bressart), who dreams of playing Shylock, is clearly a Polish Jew and from a post-1945 perspective, it's a bit chilling to hear him frequently quoting Shakespeare, saying \"If you poison us, do we not die\".

They are currently performing \"Hamlet\" and soldier Robert Stack (Sobinski), who is obsessed with Lombard and attends all her performances, is there in the audience on every occasion. Lombard and Stack arrange meetings with a pre-determined code. When Benny gives his \"To be or Not to Be\" soliloquy, that is Stack's cue to get up and leave and go backstage, much to Benny's outrage at someone getting up and leaving during his finest moment! When traitor Stanley Ridges (Professor Siletsky) passes through Poland on his way to deliver a list of names of Polish Resistance members to Hitler, the actors jump into action to prevent him reaching Germany with the list. Can they get away with their daring charades? This film is funnier than I expected and had me laughing out loud on a few occasions. Jack Benny is excellent in the lead role and the whole cast are on form. There are loads of humorous scenes and the film has a great ending to round things off. It's a shame that they cut Carole Lombard's line about what could possibly happen in a plane from the film. This would have given extra poignancy to the film given that she died in a plane crash after making this film. I think the line should have remained in there.Basically, a gang of actors come good and defeat the Nazis through various deceptions. It's lightweight entertainment that really does entertain.",

                "During and just before WWII, there were a lot of propaganda films created by Hollywood to drum up morale in our fight against Fascism. Nearly all of them were deadly serious war films. And, while many of them were great, after a while they all tended to blend together. Because of this, TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a real standout picture. The movie is a comedy and yet is every bit as effective in inspiring the war effort. Now it's not surprising that the film is so well-made as its director is Ernst Lubitsch and he is ably supported by lots of wonderful character actors such as Felix Bressart and Sig Rumand (among others). However, the nice surprise about the movie was the acting of Jack Benny in the starring role (along with the wonderful Carole Lombard). For years, Benny made fun of his acting and the movies he made, but he was great and the film was great.

                "\"To Be or Not to Be\" is an American black-and-white film from 1942, so almost 80 years old, that runs for almost 100 minutes and was directed by Ernst Lubitsch. It was nominated for one Oscar for its music and I must admit I did not find the soundtrack too memorable, but then again there is a saying that the best soundtrack is the one that does not distract any attention away from all the other components of a film. This is a definite contender for Lubitsch's most famous film from his days in Hollywood, even if other works by him attracted more Oscar attention. But the number of votes and also the really high rating are fairly telling. So not a bad choice if you want to start getting into Lubitsch's works. The most tragic thing about this film here is probably linked to the lead actress. Carole Lombard died in a plane accident before the film as released and she was only 30. She is perhaps the biggest star from the cast, but I am not an expert on American films from the 30s, just my perception. This is obviously from the days of World War II and while Lubitsch also made films during these dark times that had no connection with this war at all (because they were set earlier), this one here is all about it. There are even many references to Hitler, but also to other aspects inevitably connected to back then, like concentration camps, and it took a special set of skills really to take aspects like these and turn them into genuinely funny moment, like one character's nickname. Like I wrote in the title of my review, I thought this began really funny and if I only talkj about those moments that take place before the invasion, I may have given the film an even higher rating. Downright hilarious there with the repeated joke that one character leaves the audience when the words \"To Be or Not to Be\" (thus the title reference) are spoken and how the actor (the actor's actor) cannot deal with what he considers rejection, even if the actual rejection happens to come from his wife as he then does not know (yet). There are other really funny moments in this part and I want to say that, even if Lombard is good as well, the best performance comes from Jack Benny, not only because all the transformations (he is a true chameleon), but his face expressions were also downright funny every time, especially when he was on stage. And I also liked howw they made fun of him being a rather hammy actor. Which Hammy certainly was not, just his character maybe, that is also how he gets exposed, but I will get to that later. So big thumbs-up for Hammy, who reminded me a bit of a mix between Mark Ruffalo and the young Bruno Ganz here and there physically.Now after the invasion happens, the film gets more serious here and there (okay, cheating on your significant other is serious too, but you know what I mean, maybe nothing happened even, the film as definitely not explicit in that regard, different times I guess). There were even some moments that seemed memorable from a dramatic perspective, such as when the Nazi spy realizes he is dealing with an impostor or when the woman is not allowed to leave the place becaue the guy she met there did not give permission, even if he probably just forgot. Or the moment when the male protagonist sits in a room with the corpse of the guy he was actually pretending to be. But this scene like almost all others also resulted in a lot of comedy, so this film can definitely be called a bit of a satire and it is never really a drama about this priceless list of associates whose lives may be in danger. It could have made for a tough drama too \u00e0 la Argo, but they took a different route and the one they took, namely the comedic one, was a success. Basically all scene with Ehrhardt were really amazing (not just the concentration camp running gag), such as the mustache moments, but everything else really too. Big thumbs-up for Sig Ruman. Then again, I am not surprised. He worked with Lubitsch for example too in Ninotchka and there he was just as funny. Now back to this film here. I still think it wasn't a great watch, but a pretty decent one. It as all a bit too absurd and over the top for me the longer it went and the more characters the protagonist imitated. It's never really a weak watch, but I wished it could have had some more subtlety. And it was just really unrealistic overall too, so best way to enjoy it is maybe as a guilty pleasure I would say. Overall, there is no hesitation for me though in giving this one a thumbs-up and, like I said earlier, it's a good choice if you plan on taking a dive into Lubitsch's filmography and have not seen anything else before this one. I as lucky enough to watch this on the occasion of a Lubitsch film series in my local theater and this film is definitely among the ones I liked more, but nowhere near being close to my number one favorite. Still go check it out. I was amazed how packed the theater was by the way. Did not expect that and everybody wwas really having a fun time.",

Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.\nLater that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \"who you choose to be\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who passes off the robot as one of his works of scrap-metal art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Guy Rogard investigate. Once Mansley and Rogard are gone, Hogarth plays with the Giant using a toy gun, but inadvertently causes the Giant to activate a defence mechanism. Dean saves Hogarth and angrily commands the Giant to leave, but Hogarth, believing the Giant never meant to harm him, gives chase. Dean sees the toy gun and realizes that the Giant was reacting defensively against the gun. He catches up with Hogarth on his motorbike and they chase after the Giant before he can reach the town.\nIn Rockwell, the Giant saves two boys, instantly getting on the good side of the bewildered citizen witnesses, and leading to the Giant telling Hogarth that he chooses not to be a gun. Unfortunately, the Giant is seen by the military and attacked. The Giant flees with Hogarth until he is shot down by a missile fired from an F-86. After crash-landing, the Giant thinks that the unconscious Hogarth is dead; enraged, it activates a massive arsenal of energy weapons and attacks the Army, who are no match for the Giant's advanced firepower. Mansley lies to Rogard that the robot killed Hogarth, before telling him to lure the Giant out to sea so they can destroy it with a nuclear ballistic missile from the USS Nautilus. Hogarth wakes up and pacifies the Giant, easing him to deactivate his weapons. He then shows himself to Rogard and his men. Rogard, after listening to Dean's explanation of the Giant and realizing that Mansley lied to him, is about to tell the Nautilus to stand down, but Mansley snatches the walkie-talkie and orders the Nautilus to launch the missile. Realizing the deadly mistake, Rogard lambastes Mansley and informs him that the missile will vapourize not only the Giant, but everyone in Rockwell as well. Mansley tries to escape Rockwell to save himself, but the Giant stops him and he is arrested by the Army. When Hogarth tells the Giant about Rockwell's fate, the Giant flies off to intercept the missile. With a smile of satisfaction, comparing himself to Superman, the Giant collides with the missile, causing a massive explosion high up in the atmosphere. The people of the town recognize the Giant as a hero, but everyone, especially Hogarth, is deeply saddened by the Giant's sacrifice.\nSome time later, Annie and Dean start a relationship and Dean builds a statue honoring the Giant. Hogarth receives a package from General Rogard, containing the only piece of the Giant they found, a small jaw bolt. That night, Hogarth awakens to a familiar beeping coming from the bolt, which is trying to get out his window. He realizes the Giant is still alive and repairing himself somewhere, and he opens the window to let the bolt out. On the Langj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland, various parts of the robot approach the snowdrift where the head rests, eyes glowing, as the Iron Giant wakes up and smiles.",

                "What a GREAT movie! Not just for kids, but adults as well. Kids will love it on one level, and adults will love it on another level. Even adults who are not parents will love it!There's humor, there's action, there's nostalgia, there's the perfect capture of being a child, there are positive messages (be yourself, don't kill, etc.), there's satire, there are adults who are not stupid and not comic relief....there's GREAT WRITING!AND NO SONG AND DANCE NUMBERS! Also, there are NO COMIC-RELIEF ANIMAL SIDEKICKS! Take that, Disney! I know some people might be resisting this movie, because it looks like it's aimed for kids - and they might be expecting a Disney clone (and we all know the bad results of Disney wannabes).....but TRUST ME. Give this movie a chance - you'll love it!Is there ANYTHING wrong with it? Well, the only thing that bugged me (just a little) were some close-ups of the characters - these certain close-ups had a \"sketchy\" look a la the movies \"We're Back!\" and \"Balto\".Fortunately, there's very little of this. Other than that - this is a PERFECT MOVIE!",

                "The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

                "I'm 25 years old.  I have no children.  So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw?  Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.The film's plot is similar to 'E.T.' - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents.  Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher.  It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make.  The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature.  The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people.  We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.I dare not give away the climax.  All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending).  The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen's score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.Sadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves.  All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross.  Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years.  See it now, so you can say you discovered it before everyone else did.",

                "Animated movies have long been considered strictly for children.  The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids, but are still very watchable, even for adults.  With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics,  animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention.  THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece.  The 87 minute wonder is, to put it mildly, incredible. Everything about it is good.  I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.This is a movie with a heart the size of the title character.  A gentle, gigantic robot is rocketed to earth and befriends a 10 year old boy.  The kid has a single mother (voiced nicely by Jennifer Aniston) and he is just looking for a friend, whether it be a squirrel, or even a 50 foot tall machine.  The familiar premise is obviously out of Spielberg's E.T.  One scene even has the giant reaching out his finger to the boy in much the same way ET did to 10 year old Elliott when he departed this earth.  E.T. was an out of this world fantasy that took place on this earth.  Here, it is animated and almost just as effective.IRON GIANT takes place during 1957 in a small town in Maine.  The 1950's was a time when the American public was fearful of atomic bombs and the possibility of alien life off the earth.  Live-action sci-fi films of the 1950's always depicted the arrival of \"dangerous\" alien life and our efforts to destroy it.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is an influence on this film for evident reasons.  Ultimately, the characters in that classic learn from the extra-terrestrial being and realize the dangers of the A-Bomb.  It is amazing to see an animated feature which can relay this same type of message some 50 years later.A beautiful and touching ode to BAMBI is witnessed about halfway through. It also brings back some tearful moments from the key scene in that great, hand-drawn film.  Here, we see both hand-drawn imagery coupled with a computer-generated \"iron giant\".  The title character is actually a 3D composition done digitally, mixed with the 2D action surrounding him.  There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment.  At one point, he appears to be a lighthouse until the lights begin to blink.  I guess robots must blink too.  Enough analysis.  I loved this movie.  It is ranked #81 on the top list by other user authors for a reason.  Not only is it escapist, fantastic entertainment for kids, adults, and seniors alike, it is an animated picture like no other.  It combines the joy of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO, the commentary of 1950's science fiction, and the wizardry and laughter of TOY STORY and its sequel.  Do not miss this enchanting flick.RATING: ****",

                "\"The Iron Giant\" is the kind of animated film you wish there was more of. It respects the audience's intelligence, it has genuine emotion without resorting to schmaltz, and best of all it balances fantasy (well, science fiction) with believability.  I think Warner Brothers animation has out-Disneyed Disney by adding thoughtful writing to clean, understated animation.  What a concept!The story is deceptively simple: Iron Giant falls from the sky at the dawn of the Space Race and befriends a young boy.  But within that framework we get a double story, one for the grown ups and one for the kids, but the message is essentially the same one: paranoia and violence begets violence. I appreciate very much, as others who have commented, that no one burst into incongruous song and that there were no cutesy animal sidekicks.  I should add that there were no clever yet implausible plot twists, nor were there any stock characters.  The bad guy gets a little overheated, true, but he is never the embodiment of all things evil.  The townspeople are your average small town Americans, not bumpkins.  Mom is, well, mom-ish, caring but neither shrewish nor prone to whimpering outbursts.  And our hero is plucky but not annoyingly precocious.A BIG plus for this film is how well it weds the computer animation to the hand-drawn animation, a feat that the Big Mouse hasn't mastered yet.  Even as recently as \"Tarzan\" it is glaringly apparent what parts are computer graphics and which aren't, and the contrast is very distracting. \"The Iron Giant\" makes a virtue of streamlined animation that draws your eye to the beauty of its color and motion.It was a very VERY distinct and unusual pleasure to be treated to a film such as this.

                "All too often, \"family films\" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake.  But then along comes  something like \"The Iron Giant\", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.\"The Iron Giant\" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways.  Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula.  The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey.  The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney).  No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the \"world\" of the movie, or to advance the plot.  At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.\"The Iron Giant\" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well.  It's sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget.  Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue.  Go see it!  Tell your friends!  Then go again!  (Repeat as necessary.)P.S.

I wasn't expecting it to be that good, but The Iron Giant was an amazing movie, it is easily the most exquisite animated movie I have ever seen.Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) is obsessed by the opportunites offered by science fiction, the possibility of an alien take-over or, at the very least, an attack from outer space. The original story, which the late Poet Laureate had set in England, saw the innocent Titan of the title emerge from the sea; here he is a visitor from another galaxy.The Iron Giant is an amazing piece of animation, the voice-overs were done perfectly, the actors obviously enjoyed themselves, the animated art direction and cinematography was beautiful and the giant itself is just...breathtaking.The Iron Giant is not just another silly little kiddies movie, it is perfection in filmmaking.

                "An ambitious take on Ted Hughes' 1968 children's book The Iron Man, director Brad Bird's The Iron Giant works well as both archetype-infused allegory and heartstring-tugging tale of friendship.  Set in small town Maine in the 1950s at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film explores the relationship between a lonely, fatherless boy (a photo on a nightstand hints that the father was a combat pilot killed in WWII) and a monstrously huge, hulking metal behemoth (the origins of which are brilliantly left to the imagination).  The animation marks a welcome contrast from the virtually ubiquitous Disney template, with the human characters bearing a stylized, comic book exaggeration that fits perfectly with the story material.  The Iron Giant has more than enough imagination and sparkle to interest kids and adults, and nicely balances its action-adventure aspirations with a solidly-crafted sense of moral purpose.",

                "\"The Iron Giant\" is simply one of the best animated movies ever made. Brad Bird, the talented man that worked in shows like \"The Simpsons\" and directed the great animated film \"The Incredibles\" is the man responsible for this masterpiece. That man is a genius who is able to turn the simplest stories into gold, having an entire career of very good films. Even his \"Mission Impossible\" film (A franchise which I particularly don't like)managed to be worth-watching.Now \"The Iron Giant\" is one of my favorite films, and it is the best movie directed by Brad Bird, having not only a great animation style, but also a memorable story (Which shows that kid's films could have deep and complex stories)and many intesting characters, The Giant itself is a fascinating creature, which could be easily considered one of the most endearing figures from the entire animation history.Movies like this are enough proof that making a \"children's film\" is not a excuse for a lack of quality.

Like so many things, should I be so enamored with the technical part of the movie that I am distracted from the content. As I watched \"The Iron Giant\" I realized I had forgotten it was an animated feature. Don't get me wrong. I knew the enormous title character was animated, but the relationships among the characters and the intelligence of the script caused me to forget that these weren't actors. The movie is filled with tender moments, especially as they relate to our feelings of our own mortality. What I enjoyed is that the grownups aren't treated as garden variety bad guys. Even the military, which is nearly always portrayed as evil, finds itself in a contradictory position--having to go on faith.

                "After seeing this movie, I was overcome by a strange feeling. I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent, funny, touching, and visually superb, and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A) computer-animated, or B) based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best American-made children's movies I have seen in a decade: 8.5/10.0Now, I'm a 17-year-old who is slowly transitioning into the domain of movie buffdom, which basically means that I am watching a stream of movies based on recommendations from friends, critics, and the IMDb Top 250 list. I got this one almost by accident after the local rental place could not find the movie I was really after, choosing it basically on the knowledge that it was the previous project of Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles (a personal favorite). After watching it, I felt like calling up every mother I knew and telling her to have her children (and herself) watch this.The Iron Giant revolves around an adventurous young boy in 1950s small-town America who discovers a gigantic robot out in the woods that has arrived on Earth from goodness-knows-where. He befriends the robot, while trying to keep him safe from a nosy government agent. The story seldom lags, with a series of comical adventures connected by the boy's growing relationship with his friend. This movie is very appealing as entertainment. The voices are well-done, and the scenery is also terrific. Most importantly, though, is the animation, which is a bright spot from this time period. The characters are well-drawn, especially the Giant, who through terrific design, lifelike movements, and clever small touches (i.e., the eyes) seems both alien and human, imposing and childlike. Furthermore, the animation is comical. I don't know when I have ever seen slapstick or punchlines so well-complimented by the animation. The script, written by Bird and based off the book The Iron Man, is also very well done. Though the movie relies upon a few minor crutches common to children's movies, it is still very original and clever.One thing that I must point out about this movie is its morals. Throughout the movie, the main moral of the story, about the Iron Giant learning and choosing to be good, is actually fairly adroitly handled. At no point when the subject comes up, including standard sentimental climax, does the idea seem contrived. Throughout the movie, evidence of Bird's influence by comic books is quite evident, and his ultimate message about heroes (variations of which will resurface in The Incredibles) is relevant and sincere. However, I do have to say that the secondary moral, about the evils of xenophobia and paranoia, both of which are embodied by the movie's antagonist, the government agent and the military, are very politically charged. While this may sound initially controversial and politically charged for a kids' movie (the second of which I do not deny), I noticed that it was in large part a thoughtful spoof of Cold War America, with jokes as well as valuable lessons about \"duck and cover\" and 1950s nuclear edginess that I found very clever.On a final note, I do have to point out that this movie had me laughing hard, but more importantly, it brought me closer to tears than any animated movie I can remember (including Bambi), closer than I like to admit. I wish that I had discovered it sooner, and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it the way I did.",

The writing is great the animation is excellent and the voice acting is superb.  I don't think I've liked an English animated film this much since The Plague Dogs.  The film doesn't talk down to it's audience, and instead tells a simple story very well.  My only complaint would be that Hogarth is somewhat of a smart-alec at times, but I guess this is the era of Leave it To Beaver.Many of the situations are standard movie-fare, the ex-lax in the food, the helmet on the bed, but it's nice to see them in an animated film for a change.  As an anime fan, the realism of the movie didn't impress me as much as the quality of the writing, voice acting, and the music and sound effects.  I particularly remember the sound of the power lines snapping and the musical score building up to the climax of the film.The character design for the giant is excellent, it's amazing how they could draw out very subtle emotions without noticeably distorting the face.  I bawled like a baby near the end.Finally, most importantly for me, there are NO CHEAP LAUGHS in the movie. One of the best moments in the movie for me was when Hogarth is running through the woods and he slams his face into a low branch.  The theater full of kids raised on recent Disney crap bursts into laughter, but wait, there's no stupid sound effect, he's not hopping back up to his feet instantly with a ridiculous lump or distorted face or little birds flying around his head, he's still on the ground ... and what's that coming out of his nose.. it CAN'T BE.. it IS, a trickle of BLOOD.  The kids (and parents) quickly cease their laughter.  I couldn't stop smiling because I knew then that like me, they actually cared about the character on the screen and frankly that doesn't happen very often.Tarzan was a small step in the right direction, and near the end of the long path beginning with that step is The Iron Giant.",

Apparently, this bombed during its initial release, as it was caught between the old ways of animated films and the new breath of fresh air in Pixar. Brad Bird will become well known for the latter's stellar films, but his directorial debut may be his crowning achievement.Set during the height of the Cold War in the '50s, the story follows a young boy named Hogarth, who lives with his single mother in a small town in Maine. He's obsessed with science fiction movies and comic books and finds a paternal relationship and friendship with an otherworldly giant robot. The film balances its obvious E.T. inspired storyline with its Superman-esque inspiration as well. It's seeped with 50's iconography and mood too, giving the audience a lot of insight into the Cold War and the red scare that was so prevalent at the time the movie was taking place. Its period piece offers much more subtext than a traditionally animated film.Every character is charming and well rounded, whether it be Hogarth himself, Annie, Kent Mansley, Dean, or the Iron Giant himself. All the voice actors do extremely well too, especially Vin Diesel in the titular role, whose soft-spoken giant's relationship with Hogarth is the emotional backbone for the film. The animation and art style is beautiful, and adds to the depth of each character with exaggerated facial expressions, and offers a lot more focus on the emotions of the characters. The computer animation of the iron giant gives it an otherworldly perspective.The Iron Giant is one of the best-animated films of all time, and a classic that can be enjoyed by anyone.

                "Spoilers herein.I will admit that this is very skilled storytelling: I am really impressed with how singlemindedly every element of this film is coordinated to give a single feel which sustains -- it has to because there is no story development to speak of. So rather than focus on managing evolution of drama, `Iron' focuses on evocation of a single `feel.' And they do that well enough for me. I actually did participate in those duck and cover drills.What I find more interesting is the approach they took to the production of the film, which I find highly self-referential, and which may be the cause of a subtle effect for the viewer. At least I like to think so.The giant is drawn not by a human animator -- instead it is a three-dimensional model created in the computer. The computer then `renders' the 2-D image according to directions. The resulting figure is assembled in a scene that has hand-drawn human characters. In a very real sense, this character of a robot is acted by a robot, while the human characters are `acted' (drawn) by humans.As with all cartoony films, the voices are what you really `see' so far as the drama. But in terms of the images -- which is what all film experiences are about -- what you really see is a conflict among the religions of animators very much like what you see on the screen. That it is set in a pre-computer, but post-nuclear age -- that the lines drawn are not ones of coexistence but of good and evil -- says a lot about Bird's take on all this. A very intimate and effective film on filmmaking. Probably shouldn't be on IMDB's `science fiction' list though.",

                "Hmmm, what to say...well....  it was really good.  I've seen it several times, and I've enjoyed it immensely each time for different reasons.\nAnalytically I find the animation incredible.  The characters are extremely alive and quite realistic, not because of incredible drawing, well, actually, yes: the way the characters are drawn, and animated, is incredible.  From the jerking, swaying and swooshing of body parts to the magnificent and CONSISTENT use of eyes, eyebrows and cheekbones to show real emotions, it's definite that this movie is a masterpiece in terms of animation.  The backgrounds are wonderfully lush, and evoke a wonderful sense of everything that shows fall for the beautiful season it is.  I love animation, and I love good looking landscapes, so the artists behind this movie are making a fan out of me very quickly.I admire (analytically) most of all the enormous apparance of little details in the film: the season sublty changes from fall to winter; the characters are always doing something, even if they aren't directly in focus (the best ad-libbing a director could dream of); I also think in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity (the time and setting of the story help it to make more sense, also, the \"duck and cover\" scene)You know, I think it's amazing when sometimes a movie can move you so much, talking about it's good qualities seems like child's play.  This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and take a long time to get sick of. We all have movies like that, very few can do that to us, but we have them. I'm realising as I write that I like this movie very much, because I've written two or three paragraphs and have not even started talking about the iron giant yet.The animation and expression of emotion in the giant, who is a computer graphics animated character, a hundred feet tall and with a certain old time sci fi persona to him, equals and even surpasses it's traditionally animated companions.  There were scenes in the movie that the giant almost made me cry because of his expressions.  The director, Brad Bird I think, should earn good credit for his work bringing the giant to life.  The giant was very organic and fluid, always animated and extremely alive, without really trying to be. After a while it obvious he's not your average rigid robot.It's hard not to give away details when you write a lot, but thankfully I haven't really given anything away.  I will say this...the movie is about not prejudging things you are unfamiliar with, big or small, and it's about doing what is right and not using gray areas and politics as an excuse not to do the right thing. The movie explores the strange concept of finding friendship, love, and innocence inbetween past guilts and prejudices. It is one of the most well rounded, enriching, thought provoking movies I have seen in my lifetime, and the best part is that it wasn't the visual effects that made me say that...something other feature animation companies have used a a string to lead me on for almost a decade.  I feel like I just recovered from an extended brainwashing experiment.  I've learned my lesson. No longer will movies that use stunning graphics to redeem themselves be an interest to me.  Rather I will watch movies for the messages they give and the depth those movies have. If anything Brad Bird must have tried to make the giant as close in simplicity to the regular animated characters as possible, because you CANNOT tell the difference between CG and traditional in this movie.  Exceptional stuff.I can't imagine anyone I know not liking this movie.  I've shown it to a LOT of people, college students mostly, of all races and religions, with different prides and prejudices, the result, amazingly, always seems to be the same: I have some after movie comments here, and I quote:\"Wow!\" ; \"That was NICE!\"; \"That was SO...GOOD!\" ;\"That giant is crucial, dog!\" ;\"It was good...yeah...I liked it!\",; and \"Dang man, that joint TIGHT!\".  If you actually read this review all the way, that's nice.

                "Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form, but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters, including the giant, were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background, taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.Brad Bird who began with significant role in The Simpson's cartoon, marks his feature film debut, and would follow up with the even superior films The Incredibles and Ratatouille. The Iron Giant is part political statement, part satire and part family fare, but contains more substance then most children's films, containing passionate and is reminiscent of classics such as ET and The Lion King. Based on the book by Ted Hughes, the tale tells of a young boy in Rockwell, Maine named Hogarth Hughes voiced by unknown Eli Marienthal who, if you must put a face to the voice played Stiffler's younger brother in American Pie, in Cold War era 1958. His mother voiced by Jennifer Aniston, works late shifts at a local diner, his father has been killed (presumably in combat, as we see from a photograph he was a fighter pilot) and Hogarth who has been moved up a grade, finds himself lonely and misunderstood.On a stormy night, a mysterious object crashes off the coast, which to Hogarth's surprise (and everyone's for that matter) is a giant metal eating robot. Finding the creature to be as harmless and confused as a young boy, he befriends the behemoth, stashing him away in a local scrap yard, who the owner (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.) is not especially pleased about. After the giants shenanigans begin to be noticed, a federal agent, brilliantly voiced by Christopher McDonald, comes to investigate ands comes to suspect Hogarth may know something.The scenes where Hogarth attempts to hide the creature are the most hilarious, one sequence after the giant loses his hand (which can walk on its own once severed) our young protagonist attempts to sneak it out of the house. But don't be fooled, the iron Giant is less comedy then it is bold statement, but don't let this turn you off either.Bird's piece is riddled with political commentary on the Cold War and its effect on America and the society's obsession with warfare, weapons and at what cost freedom can be obtained, issues such as morality and death, and explores the human gift of free will, as both a blessing and as a means to do harm. The Giant, despite having every few lines is surprisingly layered and human, and has an innocence covering an inner evil turmoil. The message that you are who you chose to be is reminiscent throughout the whole film, but it never for a second feels preachy. The climax is a thrilling as any action picture, which I will say may be slightly too violent for younger children, and the closing act is as touching as any committed to celluloid.The Iron Giant is a dazzling tale and complex experience which is bound to keep you involved, entertained and will give you something to think about after leaving the theatre. Ranking as one of the best films of 1999, if The Iron Giant marks the end of the reign of the traditional animation style, I say that no finer adieu could be given in this world, or any, dare I say it, beyond this Earth.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",

Over the years it's certainly been underappreciated, but I think its grown a cult following, and getting some of the attention it deserves thanks to things like its appearance in 'Ready Player One'.Personally, I love this style of animation and genuinely miss it. It's a very touching story and one with deep meaning. I really like director Brad Bird's pitch \"What if a gun had a soul and didn't want to be a gun?\".

Intelligent, funny, tragic, and deeply moving, we'd be so lucky to ever see an American animated film strike such chords again. The look of the film is superb, and it's underlying themes and messages resonate even more strongly today. Containing a boldly pacifist theme, the film tells a story of a mechanism of war--meant to destroy--that, through the innocence of a little boy, learns to sacrifice in the name of peace and understanding, as apposed to killing in the name of ownership and power.

                "Like most reviewers here, I stumbled across The Iron Giant. Frankly, I don't know how I missed it in the theatres, but I picked up a used VHS copy a few years back and fell for it. I recently purchased the DVD version and have rekindled my appreciation for this lovely film.In addition to being a polished gem of a morality play, it is well animated, and well voice-acted. Perhaps Hogarth is portrayed as too obvious a scamp and Kent is too over-the-top in his zeal but the subtlety in the Iron Giant's limited movements and \"vocabulary\" more than make up for it. In any case, this is an animated film - we should expect \"cartoonish\" characters, right? Perhaps it was the total lack of cutesy animals doing Disneyesque song-and-dance numbers, but I found myself noticing the \"acting\" of these characters. Don't worry, I snapped out of it soon enough...Unlike some, I didn't see TIG as a slam against militarism. In fact, the General here (nicely voiced by John Mahoney) shows a considerable amount of balance. Rather, the film is about personal growth and change, respect for life, values, and the bond of friendship. This side of the film works so well that the Giant's utterance of one word - \"Superman\" - toward the end of the film sent me searching for the tissues. (word of advice: keep them handy).Do yourself and your kids and watch this film. Appropriate (IMO) for ages 3 and over (including adults!).",

I knew a couple of kids my age whose dads had never come home from a place called Korea.There are some glitches -- a 1959 Cadillac in a scrapyard in 1957, for instance, or going skinny-dipping in a lake in Maine in late October; and i'm fairly sure that (a) There was no \"Spirit\" comic in publication in 1957 and that (b) the \"Spirit\" comic cover shown is actually a painting \"Spirit\" creator Will Eisner did in the late 70s/early 80s for a reprint series.The references to films of the period -- the sand pit from \"Invaders from Mars\", the tank disintegration for \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and the animated \"Brain from Planet Arous\" on teevee are neat, too.Looking forward to next Friday's opening of Brad Bird's new film, \"The Incredibles\", though i suspect that \"Iron Giant\" will prove to be the stronger of the two...",

                "I'm going to say one thing. When I first saw this back in 2016, it did seem interesting to me. I thought it would be just an enjoyable sci fi film. But honestly, I did not expect this to be one of my favorite animated movies. The Iron Giant may possibly be the best animated movie Warner Bros has produced worldwide. At first, it seemed it was just gonna have a little cheesy giant monster film. But this is more than that. The story was incredibly written that's about a giant robot that is taught to be a civilized monster. It has profited a lot of character development. And this has presented top notch animation with some of the best effects for an animated film. It's not enough to make a reason how I consider this a masterpiece. It's how heartfelt it is. If you have actually seen monster movies, the setting is in the 50s. And you'll see they normally either take over cities or destroy the world. But this is a lot different. This is about how the giant learns about the world, what happens in life and why everyone would be afraid of him. I'm not gonna spoil it, but let's say that the ending has been a true example. No matter what, you got to watch this film. The one thing that shocked me is it wasn't much successful at the box office. And now many people has given so much attention many years later. Not only is this one of the most underrated movies I've seen, but also one of the most feel good movies I've seen. As the giant himself said it best, souls never die.",

            "A young novice is sent by her convent in 1930s Austria to become a governess to the seven children of a widowed naval officer.",
            "In 1930s Austria, a young woman named Maria is failing miserably in her attempts to become a nun. When Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp writes to the abbey asking for a governess that can handle his seven mischievous children, Maria is given the job. His wife is dead, he is often away, and he runs the household as strictly as he does the ships he sails on. The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that he keeps hiring and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives, she is initially met with the same hostility, but her kindness, understanding, and sense of fun soon draws the children to her and brings some much-needed joy into all their lives, including the Captain&#39;s. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love, even though he is already engaged to a Baroness named Elsa and Maria is still a postulant. The romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made. Their personal conflicts soon become overshadowed, however, by world events. Austria is about to come under Germany&#39;s control, and the Captain may soon find himself drafted into the German Navy and forced to fight against his own country.",
            "Maria always wanted to be a nun ever since she was a little girl, but when she grew up and joined them, she could not cope because of her wild and longing-to-be-free personality. She is, however, sent away to be the governess of seven children who give governesses a hard time and live with their widowed father who runs the house as he does his ship. Maria, however, succeeds in bringing happiness and music back to there. She and the Captain eventually start falling in love, but it can&#39;t work out due to some certain reasons.",
            "In 1930s Salzburg, Maria is a novice at a convent, she always having thought about being a nun growing up on the hills above town and being able to see above the convent walls to the goings-on inside when she was a child. The sisters, including the Mother Abbess, however openly muse about Maria&#39;s fitness as a nun, they not questioning her faith but rather her temperament, as she always seems to be getting into one form of trouble or another. As such, the Mother Abbess feels it best, against Maria&#39;s wishes, for her to leave the convent if only temporarily to see if distance will provide some clarity for all of them, Mother able to secure her a position as governess for wealthy widowed Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp&#39;s seven children, age range from sixteen year old Liesl to five year old Gretl. It is a difficult transition for Maria working under the extremely regimented mentality of the Captain who treats his children and her like they were in the military, especially since the passing of their mother, to dealing with the disruptive children who have gone through many governesses in they not wanting a governess but rather love from a present father and a mother. As Maria is able to soften the workings of the household, first with the children and then the Captain, the latter may see what the children need, namely a mother, he having chosen wealthy Vienna-based Baroness Elsa Schraeder. What he is unaware of is that while she wants to be Mrs. Captain Von Trapp and live the life of gaiety and wealth, the Baroness has no want to be a mother to the seven children. Complicating matters are, in no particular order, the Nazi takeover of Austria, the Captain ultra-Nationalistic who has no intention of working within the Nazi regime, and Maria and the Captain falling in love with each other, neither wanting to admit so both because of the Baroness and Maria&#39;s long and singular course of being a nun.",
            "In the middle of second World War, a young female is hired as a nanny to take care of the kids of a big working family. With all the trouble that is happening around them, they do everything that they can to survive and get through the difficult times."
        ],
        "synopsis": "The widowed, retired Austrian naval officer, Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) has made his Austrian home one of overly restrictive and harshly enforced discipline, one that, most unintentionally, causes his seven children to be underfed when it comes to joy and love. Being a nun living in a convent is similarly restrictive and unfulfilling for Maria (Julie Andrews), who breaks rules to try to change it. The reverend mother (Peggy Wood) decides that Maria, who is not cutting it as a nun, should leave and take on a job as governess at the nearby Von Trapp household in Salzburg.\nThrough music and various outings, Maria gives the children a taste of a more fulfilling, joyous, life than they have ever known, and they come to love her very dearly. The Captain grows closer to his children, too, coming to understand the value and beauty of the freedoms that Maria has given them. Ironically, the freedom of all Austrians to live their lives to the fullest is in danger, for it is 1938, and Germany is marching into Austria. The Captain is a patriot, passionate about the fulfilling life that Austria has always offered its citizens.\nIn his personal life, the Captain is having a romance with a wealthy, cultivated, and lovely Baroness (Eleanor Parker), but he is becoming more and more captivated by Maria, and is falling in love with her, and she, too, feels growing affection for him. She is a nun, however, and unschooled in dealing with the situaiton. Frightened by the developments, Maria runs back to the convent, where the reverend mother convinces her that she must face, rather than run from, the situation, causing Maria to return to the Captain's home. It seems, though, that she is too late, learning that the Captain and the Baroness have become engaged.\nThe Captain, who had surely concluded that he could never have Maria for a wife, confides to the Baroness that he loves Maria, but the Baroness admits she had sensed it long ago, and the engagement is called off. The Captain and Maria marry, but an ugly situation befronts them upon return from their honeymoon -- the Captain has been summoned, in a telegram, by the Third Reich to serve in its navy.\nDue to the Captain 's unwillingness to serve the Third Reich, the Captain and Maria resolve to leave Austria, and, after escaping the pursuit of some Nazi officers, they set out, with the children, for the mountains of Switzerland on foot.",

                "Capitalizing on two \"hot\" properties of the early sixties, director Robert Wise and the infinitely talented Julie Andrews, this film delivers some pure cinematic magic like none before it nor since, especially the sequences which feature the songs \"Do Re Mi\" (#88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time) through the streets of Salzburg and \"The Lonely Goatherd\", performed with puppets.These, among others, helped it capture the Best Picture Oscar that year over David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), Stanley Kramer's Ship of Fools (1965), A Thousand Clowns (1965), and Darling (1965), which (like Doctor Zhivago (1965), also) features Julie Christie, in her Oscar winning Best Actress performance. Wise, who would later receive the Irving G. Thalberg Award from the Academy, picked up his second Best Director Oscar for this film; Andrews her second consecutive Best Actress nomination (she'd won for her film debut in Mary Poppins (1964)).Written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (and Maria von Trapp's novel), Ernest Lehman's screenplay tells the story of the Austrian von Trapp family who, after their first public performance as a singing group, fled when Hitler annexed their country (the Anschluss) in March, 1938. The real von Trapp family had performed all over Europe because Maria, with the help of a local priest (fashioned as Max Detweiler, played by Richard Haydn, in the film), had turned the family's hobby into a profession when an Austrian bank crash caused Georg to lose his fortune.Though this musical is almost three hours in length, the plot interspersed with magnificent Rodgers & Hammerstein songs (helping the film to win the Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment) keep it from feeling overlong.In fact, it's the kind of film, like The Wizard of Oz (1939), that one can watch every year and never tire of it. The title song is #10 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time; \"My Favorite Things\" is #64. And no one can forget (how do you solve a problem like) \"Maria\", sung in part by Marni Nixon (known for dubbing Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn in The King and I (1956), West Side Story (1961), and My Fair Lady (1964), respectively) in one of her only on-screen appearances as Sister Sophia ... or \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\", \"Edelweiss\" and \"So Long, Farewell\", especially little Kym Karath's \"goodbye\" in the reprise, as the seven year old Gretl. Each of these tunes, and their just right lyrics, move the story along such that one never has cause to look at one's watch to wonder \"when will it end?\". The film's Sound and Editing, as evidenced in the aforementioned \"Do Re Mi\" and \"The Lonely Goatherd\" numbers, also won Academy Awards.Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is terrific as the stern aristocrat widower who marries his governess after she, and his children, had helped the Captain to rediscover song, love, and what it means to be a father. The cast of kids is marvelous, the most recognizable of which is Angela Cartwright as Brigitta, who would go on to star in the TV series Lost in Space that same year. Nicholas Hammond, Friedrich, also had a television career which included playing roles in several series, most notably as Spiderman. Heather Menzies's (Louisa) TV career was shorter. Charmian Carr gives a strong performance as the eldest child Liesl who's \"Sixteen going on Seventeen\". Peggy Wood's head Mother Abbess (whose singing voice was dubbed by Margery McKay) earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Her best line \"Him?!\", after which she immediately excuses Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), when Maria is telling her why she's returned to the abbey.I also especially like the \"dueling\" Sisters, Margaretta and Berthe (Portia Nelson) who, despite their disparate feelings towards Maria's suitability as a nun, work together to foil the Nazis in the end. Ben Wright plays a credible Herr Zeller. The recognizable Norma Varden is Frau Schmidt, the von Trapp's housekeeper. And to have the great Eleanor Parker in a supporting role as the Baroness, who presumably doesn't sing or perform (she that forgot her harmonica), such ironic and fortunate casting! Also, Maria von Trapp herself appears briefly, uncredited, during the \"I Have Confidence\" number.The film's Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Cinematography, Costume Design also received Oscar nominations. Plus, besides being added to the National Film Registry in 2001, the film is #55 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list and #27 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. #41 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list. #4 on AFI's 25 Greatest Movie Musicals list.One of the best family movie night film's ever made, make it an annual tradition in yours!",

Ever since I was child, I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning, anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast, great performances, top notch singing, and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, who is a nun, but not a very good one, and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp, and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances, both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding, every single musical number is just as good, if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals, then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing, but it is great singing by talented artists, which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 10/10 for The Sound of Music.

                "Sound of Music is one of the best musicals of all time displaying one of the greatest voices to ever be heard on the silver screen: Julie Andrews. What a wonderful movie that not only I grew up with but still treasure to this day. Sound of Music has everything you could ask for: romance, humor, singing, dancing and a wonderful cast that put their heart and soul into this film. All the songs are recognizable, although I admit that still hearing \"Few Favorite Things\" is strange during Christmas time. But moving on, Sound of Music is a classic film that is still incredible to watch and I always enjoy slipping into my DVD player to this day.Maria, a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows, the Mother Superior sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof, and his seven children virtual automatons-at least, whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise, the kids are holy terrors, as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children, especially oldest daughter Liesl, who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain, she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness. But the children insist that Maria return, the Baroness steps out of the picture, and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song \"Something Good.\" Unhappily, they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already, swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home, and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the \"glories\" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism, and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.Julie Andrews had come off fresh from Mary Poppins, which her character wasn't that far from being the nanny caring for children with a stuffy father. But the thing that made this film so special is that you honestly feel the love between Maria and Von Trapp, what a wonderful love story they had. The film is a bit long, but back in the day they had intermissions and oh, boy do I miss that. Come on, Lord of the Rings could have used one of those lol. Back onto Sound of Music, my favorite song is probably \"Confidence in Me\", such life to it due to Julie's beautiful voice and her dancing along the sidewalk could make anyone want to do the same thing. I love The Sound of Music, my boyfriend who hates musicals and said this was the crown of the worst, I asked him to watch it with me to see if he would give it another chance, I glanced over to see him singing a little to the songs! He finally admitted that the songs are very catchy, so see? You can find any little positive thing to say about this film, The Sound of Music brings you to life and you can't help but fall in love with this spectacular musical.10/10",

                "*** This review may contain spoilers ***A few days ago I was thinking,\"What Best Picutre winner should I choose for a review?\" Many to choose from of course.The answer came to me when I chose to & replayed\nthis wonderful film since it had been a few years since seeing it.I recall on The Oprah Winfrey Show ,she had Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all 7 of the, now grown, child actors who played the Von Trapp children. It was the first time they'd all been together in one place since 1965 and it was a very touching reunion.Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, The Sound Of Music was on TV every year and when you're a kid, it usually is the first \"Best Picture\" Oscar winner that you ever see in your life, without even knowing it.When you see it the first time, the moment you see Andrews in the hills and that sweeping camera shot, you know it's going to be something great.Like many kids, it was only natural I'd like songs like \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"My Favorite Things\", \"So Long, Farewell\" and \"The Lonely Goatherd\" (or \"The Yodeling Song\" as some call it) and more. I liked \"Edelweiss\" and \"Climb Every Mountain\" but not until when I was older. It was on every year in our house.Julie Andrews' singing voice is no longer of this caliber but it's great that we have her in this and \"Mary Poppins\" and other movies, where we can marvel at her vocal abilities back then.Plummer turns in a somewhat serious but enjoyable performance. Going from stern and inflexible, then back to the father the children knew when their mother was alive, fair and loving and (of course) singing.Every kid has their own memorable moments as well The family's togetherness and fun is disrupted by the infiltration of the wretched Nazi party. They know they have to escape their own country now or live under the rule of a cruel & heartless dictatorship.That leads to the most exciting part of the movie. The clever departure after the concert, chase through the city and eventual escape over the mountains.The Sound Of Music, as we know, was a phenomenal success when it was released in March of 1965. It deservedly won for Best Picture and it's other categories.That success came about because it's simply a movie that the whole family and even those without families can enjoy. Which is why it's still so highly acclaimed even now .Lastly, because the people behind the scenes, as well as Andrews & Plummer themselves, made sure the film had an equal balance of fun and that of the serious as well. A job and movie, well doneSounds like ten stars, for all time. (END)",

I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: \"It makes you feel alive\" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.",

Even the hardest hearted cynics, like myself, who aren't generally fans of musicals, cannot help but be wrapped in the charms of this film.It's almost three hours long, but it's never dull, it never feels long winded or boring. It is genuinely just the most lovely, uplifting, positive movies of all time, even to this day it still manages to captivate. Sometimes you just need something sweet and comforting, this film is like a warm woolen blanket on an icy cold day.Julie Christie actually won the Oscar that year for her role in Darling, and great though she was, I think many would say that Julie Andrews truly deserved the award for this enchanting, memorable performance. Christie's singing is enchanting.Fortunately the film did actually win the oscar for best movie, and rightly so. This film will never ever lose its charm.10/10.",

                "I know this movie is long, but it is a timeless musical nonetheless. The thing i loved most was the songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason why I love it is the magnificent performance of Julie Andrews as Maria, a young woman who wishes for a better life, I suppose. Maria is pretty, with a beautiful voice, mixed with brashness and sadness, all the qualities that Andrews gives to her performances. The only film she disappoints slightly in is Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as well as the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. i can't pick a favourite scene, but who can forget the opening and the \"Do ah Dear\" sequence? i also thought the children were sweet and the film had a number of clever subplots, like Liesels's secret love. 10/10 for a musical, that should be in the top 250.

                "This film is a triumph in all departments. Every aspect, from the cinematography to the acting, the sets to the costumes, the music, choreography, script, is top notch. While the film is family friendly and has a sweet story, it is constantly amazing the way people attack it as saccharine and sugary. This can certainly be said of the stage show, but the movie version has been carefully produced to provide a more well-rounded vision. Ernest Lehman worked wonders with the underdeveloped and unremarkable dialogue of the play. He inserted so many moments of wit, humor, romance and poignancy that are nowhere in sight in the original. the art directors purposefully chose muted settings and colors. Each of the actors bent over backwards to provide a brilliant performance. Andrews is already down in history for the performance of a lifetime (and a voice to match), but Plummer is not to be forgotten. Not only is he regal and handsome, but his decision to play the Captain as a complex, sophisticated man with a sly dose of sarcasm was wonderful. His steely, stern persona is eventually melted down by the irrepressible Andrews to great effect. Every supporting performance is also delivered with the right amount of appeal, humor or menace as called for in the script. However, the one that takes the cake....that amazes each time, is the slinky, catty, toweringly glamorous Parker as Baroness Schraeder. Wisely, her songs were cut, further separating her from all the glee around her, so that she could whip out such zingers as \"Why didn't you tell me....to bring along my harmonica?\" or when she's told that Andrews may not make a great nun, \"If you need anything, I'd be happy to help you.\" The character is given a much more polished and integral position in the film versus the stage and virtually every line of her dialogue (unlike in the play) is a howler. Though Wood was lovely in her role as the Mother Abbess, it was Parker who should have gotten an Oscar nod....and WON! Every expression, every syllable, every glance belies the decades of experience Parker gained as a leading lady during the 40's and 50's. Her clothes by Dorothy Jeakins are awe-inspiring. This type of film-making is GONE. The location photography, the simplicity of story and design, the sheer good-spiritedness of it all...they just can't do this anymore. Thankfully, there's this flawless gem to turn to when one just want to feel good. But saccharine? No..... Compare this to other beloved musicals with their garish colors and sugary story lines (\"Seven Brides...\", \"Singin' in the Rain\", \"...Molly Brown\", \"The Music Man\", to name just a few...) They are all highly enjoyable, but are hardly less sweet than this! Just one word.....Nazis!! Though virtually everyone knows the outcome, there is still genuine suspense at the climax of \"The Sound of Music\". The film has it all.",

Julie Andrews (Oscar-nominated) stars as the young nun who leaves the convent to become the governess to a large family. She is instantly at odds with the children's father (Christopher Plummer), but they soon fall in love and get married.  However, evil forces lurk overhead as the Nazis invade their homeland of Austria.  Somewhat based on a true story, \"The Sound of Music\" is one of those rare musicals that works because there is a sense of fear and drama in the film's final act.

                "In pre-WWII Salzburg, Austria, the Mother Abbess doesn't know what to do with the flighty Maria (Julie Andrews). How do you solve a problem like Maria? Maria fearfully accepts being the governess to Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s seven children. The kids don't like her at first. She is the 12th in a long line of governesses. She eventually wins them over. The Captain is a widower who runs a cold strict household. The Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) accompanies him back from Vienna with singing producer Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn). However he starts to fall for the lovely governess and she for him. The jealous Baroness pushes her out of the way and the Captain asks the Baroness to marry him.Everybody is entitled to their opinion but I can't imagine anybody not appreciating the simple joy of this musical. The main objections seem to be the movie's departure from the real story. I don't know how much Nazism these critics want but it is a musical after all. Nobody is watching this for its authenticity. The songs are simply innocent fun. They are endlessly singable and Julie Andrews is the perfect Broadway ing\u00e9nue with great screen presence.

                "The Sound of Music (1965)For all the liberties made to historical accuracy, I think it goes without saying, a movie is being made, and without certain poetic license, the bird of genius cannot fly, so leeway must be given... and in so doing here, a truly important and beautiful result is made. Captain Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) stone intensity as a disciplinarian who has forgotten how to love, who has lost his inner music after the death of his wife, is softened and freed through the inspiring lightness of Maria's (Julie Andrews) enchanting entrance into he and his seven children's life as the house's new Governess... While the leads balance each other, the sweetness of the music is equally balanced by the sobriety of the situation in which they find themselves, during the Nazi occupation of Austria. What intrigues me is that in the song \"16 Going on 17\" the young boy Rolf who appears to be in love with Leisl warns her of being seduced by men, but in the end it is he who is seduced, by the Nazis... and it is so often the case in life that while teaching others we grow cocky and forget that we too are still students, and capable of falling prey to our own folly... We also must understand though, even as the Von Trapp family escapes over the Alps to Freedom (the truth is they fled by train during the day to Italy), that those who helped them may not get off so lightly even though it is unshown in the film... the nuns who would obviously be recognized as having helped them by removing the car's carburetor, the man at the festival would likely be found complicit in helping them escape, and I mention them because it is impossible not to think of those who gave their lives to help so many escape the Nazis tyranny, and now it is our turn to help new refugees escape tyranny... the more that things change, the more they stay the same... I am an emotional person, and connecting emotionally with characters does help enjoyment, but also confirms bias and dilutes objectivity for sure... but ultimately, I believe The Sound of Music earns all five of its Oscars.The Amazon film ends with a one-hour behind the scenes look into the film and the Von Trapp family hosted by Julie Andrews. A perfect way to end the film.And like Maria, like Julie Andrews, my life is truly eased through singing my music, so perhaps as a singer, as a Jew, I relate quite intimately with the story.And it is true as is sung in the movie, and I leave you with that idea now... \"My heart will be blessed with the sound of music.

                "I was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music on Broadway with the original cast minus Mary Martin, her part had been taken over by Martha Wright at that point. The production was good, but the thing I like best about The Sound of Music was how well Robert Wise transferred it to the screen. I defy anyone to show any trace of stage origin in this magnificently photographed film from that aerial opening with Julie Andrews singing the title song to the end with the Von Trapp family climbing every mountain.The main difference between the stage production and the screen version is that the role of the Baroness Elsa Schrader played by Eleanor Parker is a singing role. With the casting of Ms. Parker, a talented player but no singer, certain songs out of necessity had to be eliminated. Eleanor is fine in her role, but I do wonder if Robert Wise meant to cast a singer in her part originally. On Broadway the Baroness was played by Marion Marlowe.Julie Andrews who became a Broadway star in My Fair Lady and Camelot and didn't do either role for the screen, gives her greatest screen performance in a Broadway role originally written for someone else. There was some criticism that Mary Martin was too old to be playing Maria in the original play, but she certainly was guaranteed box office on Broadway. Julie Andrews was just right for the part and she's in great voice. I always marvelled listening to her at the perfect diction she was able to maintain hitting those high notes.Christopher Plummer took over the role that Theodore Bikel on Broadway and he too gained a signature role for his screen career. I've always felt that the talented Mr. Plummer has never been given the credit due him. He was a perfect Duke of Wellington in Waterloo and his portrayal of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire is the highlight of that film. I like Christopher Plummer because he's also never taken himself seriously though he takes his art very seriously. I don't think too many other actors today could have played that comic villain in the Tom Hanks/Dan Ackroyd Dragnet movie and done it with such obvious zest and enjoyment.A real old timer got into this film with Peggy Wood playing the Mother Abbess at the Convent where Maria is a postulant. Ms. Wood's Broadway career dates back to 1911 and on stage she introduced songs by such people as Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, and Noel Coward. You've got to be real good to get folks like that to write for you. And now her art is preserved in one of the most popular films of all time.The charm of the music and the leads and the kids sometimes obscures the anti-Nazi message that The Sound of Music conveys. The story takes place in Austria before and during the Anschluss. Christopher Plummer makes no secret of disgust for the Nazis and all they stand for. The Sound of Music makes it clear he is very much in a minority in terms of Austria uniting with Germany. Of course the irony is that Anschluss did not quite turn out for the Austrians as they hoped it would.The Sound of Music, it's story, it's music, it's lyrics and it's charm will stay with you and never leave after a hundred viewings.",

                "A spirited nun leaves her convent and becomes a governess in pre-war Austria. Here she teaches the six children about love, life and music against the growing threat of Nazism.Your fingers hesitate on the keyboard before making comment on a film that is more a phenomena than a stretch of celluloid. This wasn't just a smash hit in the normal western markets - it also went huge everywhere and has stayed huge. The whole Indian film industry is descended from the template set down here.While this was a well regarded stage musical, this wasn't seen as a natural box office smash (a musical based on the life of a nun!) and was probably thrown to Robert Wise (more an action - than a music - man) because he was known for being able to operate well on a budget (all those B pics!)It was just as well, production was hellish: They had forgotten (didn't know?) how moody the European weather could be (even in Summer) and the genuine Austrian period folk songs didn't shine (new ones were quickly written); and beyond that many of the children had no real film acting experience.The success of the film is nothing but a bag of paradoxes, the must striking being that is was old fashioned even when it was released. Beat based pop music was dominating the sales charts and the sixties were beginning to swing. Hem lines were going up hair lines were going down and James Bond had already introduced casual sex and violence to the screen.This may have been made in 1965 - but it could easily have been made 20 years earlier and is the (off-screen) product of people that probably were coming to the end of their best creative period. Oscar and Hammerstein had already penned most of their famous musicals and must have been amazed that they struck their largest gold reserve so late in the day.As Noel Coward once observed, the one thing that critics overlook is that the public are looking for simple minded entertainment, not messages or meaning. And this is both simple minded and entertaining (if you can live with heavy schmaltz). There are certainly no messages, unless you need to be told that love and music are good and Nazi take-overs are bad!The songs don't so much act as light relief, but provide the film with a life support machine. As drama the whole thing can't get out of second gear - even the Nazi threat doesn't raise the drama level beyond village theatre. I also guess we are supposed to know what these people really represent from other sources?Julie Andrews performance is massively underrated. Here is someone that has to sing, dance and act with children (sometimes all at the same time!) and yet makes it look easy, natural and spontaneous. When has, say, Robert De Niro ever done anything as technically difficult as this?In many ways SOM is bullet proof (can you imagine Mel Brooks/Jerry Zucker doing a spoof?) family entertainment. A plot everyone can follow, charming children, excellent score, pretty scenery, perfect lead and a happy ending - if not for the rest of war torn Europe!As a footnote. Twentieth Century Fox lost all the profits they made on this film on musical follow ups that included Hello Dolly, Star and Dr Dolittle - which makes clear that the whole thing was, indeed, just a giant happy accident and musicals were not what the audience secretly wanted all along.",

I mean it--DON'T READ ON.....I adored \"The Sound of Music\" when I saw it for the first time when I was 16. I loved the film and was completely infatuated with Julie Andrews. Frankly, this isn't at all surprising as practically EVERYONE was in love with Julie Andrews after they watched the film! What wasn't to like?! The music was AMAZING, the story very romantic and the film uplifting throughout. However, I made a mistake. I loved the film so much that I read up on the real Von Trappe family--and it was little like the wonderful family in the film! The Captain was actually always a pretty nice guy and Frauline Maria wasn't exactly 'practically perfect in every way'! To make things MUCH worse, I traveled to Salzburg, Austria several decades later--and I learned THE TRUTH!!! The wonderful Von Trappe home in the film was actually a composite of about a half dozen different homes in the area! The gazebo was miles from the riverfront which was miles from the interior of the Von Trappe home--and the truth got worse! When we visited the cemetery where the family hid out at the end of the film, we were shocked (and VERY offended) at a memorial in this cemetery for the SS--the same folks that manned the death camps! All in all, this is a case where the truth really, really hurt. And, although I am a history teacher who loves historical accuracy, this is a case where I wish I'd never learned the truth.

It was seven years before anyone was able to sit me down in front of the T.V to the musical during the annual telecast in Sydney. Almost to my horror, I was falling in love with the musical. More than two years later, not a single movie has been able to pass it in my favourite movies stakes. I have made judgemental mistakes with great movies. Greats like \"Casablanca\", \"The African Queen\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" have originally also been frowned upon. \"The Sound of Music\" expanded my horizons on the movie world. I eventually went on to view non-musical classics as a result of this single movie, and now old classic movies have become a genuine passion. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote their greatest work in the form of their last musical, despite the fact it was \"Carousel\" that was their favourite. Although the changes made from the original stage production have now been evident in the arrival of the excellent musical currently playing in Sydney, much have been for the better. Throughout their career, the duo created immortal musicals, but in story, song and film, \"The Sound of Music\" surpasses \"The King and I\", \"Oklahoma!\", \"Carousel\" and \"South Pacific\" in all aspects. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, \"The Sound of Music\", \"My Favourite Things\", \"Do-Re-Mi\" or \"Edelweiss\". Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken novice nun turned governess, who should have taken out the oscar that year. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965.Yes, there are sugary elements in the movie that cannot be denied. But this movie has never been reliant upon sex, violence or drugs to make it one of the best things to come out of Hollywood. It can be appreciated truly for what it is, pure art, talent and spirit. It is not a real perception of the world nowadays, but for all the joy it brings, who cares?It was the last movie I expected to love as a fourteen year old. It was also the first movie I watched in seven years that could manage to make me shed tears, and view it in loving admiration which cannot be equalled.\n\"Singin' In the Rain\" is the only other contender to the title of \"The greatest movie ever made\".

                "\"The Happiest sound in all the world\"? Quite possibly and easily the most famous musical film in Hollywood history. Most of us grown-ups still love it but at the same time we're also tired of seeing it over and over again (maybe that's why it's not rerun on NBC every single year anymore). Julie Andrews takes her MARY POPPINS success and adds even more to it with her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin originated on the Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could. In my opinion, and I don't think I'm alone here, Martin was too old for the part (she was in her mid to late 40s in the stage version and Andrews was 30 when the transition came to film came around--a perfect age). As for the rest of the cast, it is just as talented: Christopher Plummer in the role he will be forever remembered for (even though he hated the part) is an achingly true Cap. Von Trapp with those \"hidden talents\" making subtle appearances throughout the film until blatantly bursting out into the open in the film's closing scenes; Richard Haydn makes for a comical and yet sincere \"Uncle\" Max, Peggy Wood is a starchy yet compassionate Reverand Mother and Charmian Carr as Liesl stands out as our perrenial favorite of the seven children. The locales are breathtaking as well (esp. the opening scenes which is probably the most beautiful aerial shot in all of film history and the cunning floral designs of the public Austrian gardens during the DO-RE-MI sequence). So let's all keep watching this most cherished of all musical films each year and never forget it's universal sentiment: to 'climb ev'ry mountain, ford ev'ry stream, follow ev'ry rainbow till you find your dream'.",

As a big fan of hers, I can watch this musical over and over and just sigh.Wise and his cinematographer have photographed Andrews in a manner that no other director has--even her husband. Watch the scene where Maria watches the Captain sing Edelweiss with the kids. Wise turns her into a gauzy angel. It is a fantastic moment among hundreds that this movie contains.I am firmly in a camp that says Julie Andrews was completely, utterly, and regrettably robbed when the 1965 Oscars were handed out. She embodied Maria Von Trapp, wholly and with every fiber of her being (just watch the scene in which she races the boys in a segment of \"Do-Re-Mi\"; she runs at the camera with utter abandon here, no holding back. Or consider the shot at the end of this song, where she places her hand atop her head--it's as if even SHE can't believe she's hitting that note).The Julie Christie performance that beat Andrews is now all but forgotton. \"The Sound of Music,\" however, lives on and on.\"The Sound of Music\" is a bit bittersweet for me, given that audiences tastes would soon turn away from big-budget musicals in general and Julie Andrews specifically.

                "There's a running joke at my house: every time I watch The Sound of Music, I remark, \"I liked this movie more than ever this time around!\" My mom laughs at me, since I seem surprised that it's such a good movie. When I was a kid, however, I didn't like it that much, which is why I am always surprised by how wonderful it is when I watch it all grown-up. As a child, I fell asleep during the long running time, and I didn't understand the wartime setting. The only musical number I loved was \"I Have Confidence,\" and I would have been perfectly happy to see that song on a continuous loop for three hours.As an adult, \"I Have Confidence\" is still my favorite song and scene of the film, and I never get tired of appreciating all Julie Andrews put into the physicality and expressive singing. It's very funny that that song is my favorite, since it wasn't included in the original stage musical; but to me, it perfectly showcases Maria's character. She's eager to help, anxious to be liked, headstrong, well-intentioned, enthusiastic, and adorable. Without that song, it might take a longer time to understand why the children love her and why the captain thaws. But in three minutes, before she even rings the doorbell, she's irresistible.It's not a necessity to love Julie's performance, but it adds extra appreciation if you've seen The Sound of Music on the stage. It's incredibly different, not only because her songs were originally written for an alto, and not only because she doesn't twirl on top of the Swiss Alps singing the title song, but because all the infectious energy and great loving nature comes directly from Julie Andrews. It's not exactly written into Maria von Trapp, but Julie put it there.From child to adult, I always loved Eleanor Parker playing the elegant, classy baroness. Her clothes are so beautiful, and she uses a subtle delivery to change a villainous character into a sympathetic one. While I'm sure other actresses would have loved to play the baroness, like Joan Fontaine or Anne Baxter, Eleanor was extremely likable. I can't imagine anyone else convincing the audience that Julie Andrews should return to the nunnery.Thankfully, the story is about Maria and her relationship with the entire von Trapp family. If the main plot focused on the captain, I wouldn't like the movie nearly as much. Every time I watch it, I try to find something in Christopher Plummer's performance to like, but I never do. Peter Finch would have been wonderful, with more pain and less flippancy - and he can sing, too! Another fantastic choice would have been Curd Jurgens, who also sings, and who would have spoken in an authentic accent. And, given his personal background, there would be added emotional drama in the last portion of the film; if he sang goodbye to his country in front of Nazi officers, it would have an entirely different meaning.But with all there is to love about the movie, does anyone (besides me) care about a little botch in the casting department? Robert Wise's imaginative directing turns lackluster (no offense) songs like \"Do-Re-Mi\" into a sightseeing tour-de-force, and the beautiful sets of the von Trapp estate really show the audience what the family is willing to leave behind. Julie Andrews breathes new life into all her songs, whether she's on top of a mountain or merely conducting a puppet show. Even folks who don't like \"The Lonely Goatherd\" love the way it's filmed in the movie, with such attention to detail as the kids \"control\" the puppets. The first half is whimsical, the second half is suspenseful, and each viewing is totally absorbing. Although it faced stiff competition at the 1965 awards season, the Hot Toasty Rag board members agreed with the Academy Awards (a rare occurrence) that it was indeed the best picture of the year.",

                "1965's \"The Sound of Music\" is everything a bad musical should be. Providing more sap than a forest full of Vermont maples, it has coy, silly songs, an inane, innocuous script, and unbelievably sugary characters.  So why is it one of my favorite musicals?  OK, go ahead.  Shoot me at twenty paces.  But after all this time, it still remains a guilty pleasure.  I find myself going for a tub of rocky road ice cream and Rodgers & Hammerstein's immortal classic whenever the real world gets to be too much.  I seem to play it a lot around tax time.And I'm not alone.  Why is it still considered the most popular musical of all time?  Well, first of all they spared no expense.  The extremely well-produced blockbuster has gorgeous, eye-popping scenery.  From the first moment Julie Andrews flails her arms and circles around on that beautiful sunny hillside singing the rousing title song, I know I'm being swept away to another world.  I'm not in Kansas anymore...or L.A., anyway.  The panoramic Salzburg background complements and never intimidates or takes away from the characters or their story (like the other R & H extravaganza \"South Pacific.\")  That in itself is an incredible feat.Now about those songs.  Almost every one of them is absolute drivel.  So what makes them work?  Easy.  The utter joy and sincerity of the cast who sings the infectious, hummable tunes, which are backed by  extremely moving orchestrations and an exceptionally beautiful score.  It's hard to resist Maria prancing about, pillow-fighting with a bunch of knee-highs and gushing about her most favorite things.  Or the austere Captain Von Trapp (the meticulous Christopher Plummer) turning to butter after hearing his brood sing in perfect harmony for the first time (with no prior lessons even) and joining right in.  Or the Mother Superior's soaring number that unknowingly forewarns Maria to head for the hills (I mean, mountains) before the Nazis escort them elsewhere.  Or the 16-year-old going on 17 squealing with delight after receiving her first kiss.  Or the kids working up a clever little ditty to leave their formal party guests when its time for bed.  Or two people declaring their love in a moonlit gazebo.  The songs work because they come straight from and aim for the heart, not the head, which is exactly the place the viewer should be coming from when watching this movie. If the songs don't transcend the script (which they didn't prior to the 70s), they certainly transcend the mood.The script is undeniably trite and probably the film's weakest link.  But again, the characters play it straight all the way.  Not one actor looks embarrassed.  Every scene is done with total enthusiasm and total commitment, and the performers who are telling the story are pitch-perfect and picture perfect. And as for the characters.  Try and think of anybody better than jubilant, crop-haired Julie Andrews as a postulant nun who has gorgeous pipes, can make play clothes out of curtains, can set up and operate marionette shows at the drop of a hat, and is confident enough to convince a man that a failed nun is ideal marriage material.  I certainly can't.  Thank heavens for her Oscar-winning \"Mary Poppins\" the year before or we might have gotten Julie LONDON instead!  After all, Andrews did lose out on \"My Fair Lady\" the year before.  But now  certifiably bankable, she proved she could handle this dream role.  Andrews is cutely silly, cutely stubborn, cutely astute, cutely shattered and cutely...well, cute.  She gives the most wholesomely appealing musical perf since Judy Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz.\"  To actually make you forget Mary Martin in the Broadway role takes some doing and she does it effortlessly.  Christopher Plummer is all seriousness, handsomely patrician, and quite a catch for anybody...much less a nun.  I can't think of anyone more suitable for this role either.  As for the Seven Little Foys, I mean the Von Trapp children, they are adorable and perfect in their own ways too, whether they are marching or singing,  creating their own individual personalities by film's end.Richard Haydn as Max and Eleanor Parker as the flamboyant, haughty Baroness provide wonderful catty relief.  Despite having their musical numbers snatched away from them, they make up for it with droll, sophisticated humor.  The elegant, perfectly coiffed Parker is particularly delicious as Maria's chief romantic rival, getting some of the film's best zingers and delivering them with biting understatement.  Parker developed a devout cult following after this role.  Peggy Wood's Mother Superior is suitably reverent and inspiring.For those who tear \"The Sound of Music\" apart for its shameless, sugar-coated manipulations, well, I can respect that.  But to attack it for its political and historical inaccuracies is like attacking \"Peter Pan\" for being a subversive plot that encourages young children to run away from home.  It's ludicrous.  Despite the fact that it's based on a true story, we're not watching \"The Sound of Music\" for stark realism.  Like a sparkling and lavish Ernst Lubitsch operetta, we want a feel-good movie, with feel-good songs, with a feel-good story, and a feel-good ending.  Nothing more.  If you want a movie that presents a potent depiction of pre-war Austria or anti-Nazi sentiment, rent \"Holocaust\" or \"Schindler's List.\" Here, we want to believe that a group of nuns can tear out an automobile carburetor and save the world!  Period.I suppose the reality-based MTV generation cannot truly respect or relate to the relative innocence and pure escapism like \"The Sound of Music.\"  If this movie was made today I'm afraid the Von Trapp children would not be dangling out of trees for fear of drive-by shooters.  It's a tough new world today, sad to say.  The 50s and 60s are looking better all the time.Anyway, for what it's worth, \"The Sound of Music\" is indeed schmaltz, but its QUALITY schmaltz at its very, very best.",

                "If \"West Side Story\" was the best musical film of the sixties, then \"The Sound of Music,\" adapted from the long-running Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family, was certainly the most popular\u0085 With a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment (the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves), religion (in the Hollywood tradition of serene, kind nuns), romance (actually two romances, one adult, one adolescent), and anti-Nazi feeling (Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invaders)\u0097and with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid, conscientious craftsman and a fluent story-teller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions, \"The Sound of Music\" is perfect with its sumptuous location photography, immaculate, fluid editing, and splendid tones\u0085 The film does have a justifiably famous opening: the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews, as mischievous, warmhearted Maria, exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley\u0085 It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again, but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter (Charmian Carr) meets her shy beau (Daniel Truhitte) in the family garden, he sings \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" to her, and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo\u0085 Maria's music lesson to the children, \"Do-Re-Mi,\" is beautifully staged, set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg, changing their clothing through camera wizardry\u0085 And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest, \"Edelweiss,\" with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and Hammerstein\u0085Another of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and self-confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self-esteem... It works to balance the tight-lipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the \"adorable\" posturings of the children, and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness...",

                "Not many films can achieve the flat out beauty that you see in The Sound of Music. The mesmerizing European landscapes and Julie Andrews' voice, not to mention the cute performances by the children, especially in their goodbye song, make this film not only the best musical of all time, but one of the best films of all time.Yes, I did say best musical. Singin in the rain is sewer water compared to this. Not that Singin is a bad musical, but not as good. The Wizard of Oz is learning how to make fire, The Sound of music is inventing the Flying car. This film is timeless, beautiful, inspiring, and uplifting, but I would advise that anyone who watches this would be mature enough, for anyone under the age of 15 will brush this movie aside, saying it is lame so as to maintain their level of coolness. I saw this happen when I asked my little sisters to watch it with me. They rolled their eyes and said the movie was terrible and boring. If only they understood. You have to have an open mind, and forget everything every little kid has said negative about this film. I never wanted to watch this, but some fellow high school seniors RECOMMENDED it to me. Obviously they had open minds, and they didn't care if they looked cool or not. Please watch this movie. It will make you happy, and it is so beautiful, you will almost cry. I had never really liked musicals, and perhaps I still do not overly enjoy them, but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven, which is where it should belong, not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours. To simply conclude, you will never see a more heart-stopping beautiful movie in your life.",

                "The \"Sound of Music\" is set in the mountainous hills and the city of Salzburg, Austria. There is to my eye at least, something about its spacious alpine countryside which dominates and informs the entire production. The air, the light, the music, the styles of dress, the activities--everything is \"elevated\", with hardly anything being sea-level about it. And the film has a very good \"engagement sequence\" at the opening, when we learn about the central ethical character and experience her leaving the abbey where she has served along with her, and begin to care about her purposes. The story-line is simple and relatively direct: A young nun, unsuited to the profession, takes a job as a governess to the children of a difficult client--a captain in the Austrian navy who runs the household like a ship's company of sailors, complete with a bosun's whistle and a lineup of the children in matching uniforms. The body of the piece is then concerned with Maria, the governess, subverting the household and winning over the Captain until he gives up his present lady friend, a Baroness; then when Maria, who has been falling in love with him, goes away and comes back, he has to tell her he is in love with her also. They marry, to the children's delight in a great ceremony in a rebuilt replica of Salzburg's cathedral; but a Nazi Parrty official has words with the Captain. The family, against the Captain's former feeling, then enters the Sazlburg musical festival as the Von Trapp Family singers, something he had earlier opposed; and, winning the contest, they flee and are helped at her old abbey by Maria's Prioress and her friends there. The nuns sabotage the Nazis' cars by stealing parts, and Captain Von Trapp leads his family up over the mountain pass to freedom as the film ends. This happy film is filled with tuneful songs ranging from the ultra-simple \"Eidelweiss\" ballad to \"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria\" , \"Do Re Mi\", \"My Favorite Things\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"I Have Confidence\", \"The Lonely Goatherd\", \"Something Good\", \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" and the voice-challenging \"Climb Every Mountain\". Robert Wise directed this complex film, which features many sorts of scenes. Everything to me looks clean, bright and, frequently, even Austrian. Ernerst Lehman wrote the screenplay from the Broadway \"book\" by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse that borrowed its fictionalized biography from Maria Augusta Trapp's autobiographical work; Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II supplied the music and lyrics. Ted McCord provided lucid cinematography, with the production being designed by Boris Leven. Ruby R. Leavitt and Walter M. Scott did the complex set decorations while famous Dorothy Jeakins created the many vivid costumes. In the large cast, Julie Andrews was a charming Maria, though she was not particularly Austrian. Christopher Plummer had some very good moments as the Captain, Eleanor Parker played the Baroness with great skill and Richard Haydn was the Captain's impresario friend, Max. Ben Wright was the Nazu gauleiter, Peggy Wood the Mother Superior, and among the nuns were Anna Lee, voice-dubbing soprano Marni Nixon, Evadne Baker and Portia Nelson., In the cast also were Daniel Truhitte, Norma Varden, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, with the children Charmian Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Angela Cartwright, Heather Menzies, Duane Chase, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath. It is a bit difficult for me as a writer to account for the highly-positive qualities of the film, since in my judgment they exceed the sum of the film's parts. The characters and relationships seem real to the viewer, I suggest, because we discover them along with Maria; her personal dilemmas are interesting, and the use of the Nazi Anschluss as a threat, a problem for the Captain, and a dark cloud hanging over the sunlit lives of the folk in the film works very well. The contrast for instance between the nuns' early disagreement over Maria's character and their helping to thwart the Nazis pursuing the family at the film's climax becomes a highly-symbolic movement; and like the growing love between Maria and the Captain and the children's being won over by their new governess, because the movement again is allowed to develop by slow stages, the satire-level comedy with its touch of drama works powerfully on an audience. There is much to be admired in the simplicity and the beautiful imagery of this film; if it is not an artistic masterpiece, it is frequently absorbing, moving and unaffected all at the same time.",

        "synopsis": "Dorothy Gale (\nJudy Garland\n) is an orphaned teenage farm-girl who lives with her Auntie Emily Gale (\nClara Blandick\n) and Uncle Henry Gale (\nCharley Grapewin\n) on a Kansas farm in the early 1900s. She daydreams about going \"over the rainbow\" after Miss Gulch (\nMargaret Hamilton\n), an aggressive neighbour, hits Dorothy's dog Toto (\nTerry\n) on the back with a rake, causing Toto to bite her. Miss Gulch shows up with an order to take Toto to the sheriff to be euthanise him, but Toto jumps out of the basket on the back of Miss Gulch's bicycle and runs back to Dorothy. Fearing that Miss Gulch, who does not know that Toto has escaped, will return, Dorothy takes the dog and runs away from home. She meets an itinerant phony fortune teller, Professor Marvel (\nFrank Morgan\n), who immediately guesses that Dorothy has run away. Pretending to tell her fortune and wishing to reunite Dorothy with her aunt, he tells her that Auntie Em has fallen ill from worry over her.\nDorothy immediately returns home with Toto, only to find that the wind is picking up and a massive tornado is approaching. Unable to reach her family in their storm cellar, Dorothy enters the house, is knocked unconscious by the cyclone's violence, and apparently begins to dream. Along with her house and Toto, she's swept from her dull sepia-toned world to the magical, beautiful, dangerous and Techni-colourful Land of Oz, a faraway fantasy realm. The tornado drops Dorothy's house on the Wicked Witch of the East (also link=nm0002121) , crushing and killing her. The Witch ruled the Land of the Munchkins, dwarfish humanoid people who think at first that Dorothy herself must be a witch. The Wicked Witch of the West (\nMargaret Hamilton\nagain), who is the sister of the dead witch, appears and threatens to kill Dorothy for revenge. But Glinda (\nBillie Burke\n), the Good Witch of the North, gives Dorothy the dead witch's enchanted Ruby Slippers, and the slippers protect her. Glinda advises that if Dorothy wants to go home to Kansas, she should seek the aid of the Wizard of Oz, who lives in the Emerald City. To get there, Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road.\nBefore she has followed the road very far, Dorothy meets a talking dim-witted Scarecrow living in a field whose dearest wish is to have a brain. Hoping that the wizard can help him, the Scarecrow (\nRay Bolger\n) joins Dorothy on her journey. They come upon an orchard of talking apple trees, where they find a tin statue of a lumberjack. The Tin Woodsman (\nJack Haley\n) then begins to speak, explaining he was caught in the rain and is so rusty and cannot move. When they oil his joints so he can walk and talk again, he confesses that he is a heartless robot and longs for a heart; he then too joins Dorothy on the quest. As they walk through a dense forest, they encounter the talking Cowardly Lion (\nBert Lahr\n), who wishes for courage and joins the quest in the hope that the Wizard will give him some. Dorothy begins to realise her three friends resemble the three farmhands who work for Dorothy's aunt and uncle back in Kansas.\nOn the way to the Emerald City, Dorothy and her friends are hindered and menaced by the Wicked Witch of the West. She incites trees to throw apples at them, then tries to set the Scarecrow on fire. Within sight of the city, the witch conjures up a field of poppies that cause Dorothy, Toto, and the lion to fall asleep. Glinda saves them by making it snow, which counteracts the effects of the poppies.\nThe four travelers marvel at the wonders they find in the Emerald City a guard (Frank Morgan) does not let them in but agrees then, the horse driver (Frank Morgan again) takes them for a drive and takes time to freshen up: Dorothy, Toto and the Lion have their hair done, the Tin Woodman gets polished, and the Scarecrow receives an infusion of fresh straw stuffing. As they emerge looking clean and spiffy, the Wicked Witch appears on her broomstick and sky-writes \"Surrender Dorothy\" above the city. The friends are frustrated at their reception by the \"Great and Powerful\" Wizard of Oz (\nFrank Morgan\nagain) -- at first the guard won't receive them at all. When they finally see him The doorkeeper (Frank Morgan again) lets them in because he had an Aunt Em himself. The Wizard then appears as a gigantic fiery green ghostly face, and declines to help them until they bring him the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. Daunted but determined, they set off again.\nThe Witch sends her minions, the Winged Monkeys, to attack Dorothy's party before they reach her castle; the monkeys snatch Dorothy and Toto and scatter the others and bring them to the Witch's lair in the Winkle Castle. When the Witch finds that the Ruby Slippers cannot be taken against Dorothy's will as long as the girl is alive, she turns her hourglass and threatens that Dorothy will die when it runs out. Meanwhile, Toto has escaped and run for help. Dressed as guardsmen, the Lion, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow sneak into the castle and free Dorothy. They are discovered before they can escape, however, and the Witch and her Winkle Guards corner them and set the Scarecrow on fire. Dorothy douses him with a pail of water, also inadvertently splashing the Witch by accident. Somehow, the water causes the Witch to disintegrate and dissolve to death ( as she screams \"I'm melting!\"). The guards are happy to let Dorothy have the Witch's broomstick, and Dorothy and her friends return to the Emerald City.\nThe Wizard is not pleased to see them again. He blusters until Toto pulls aside an emerald curtain in the corner of the audience chamber to reveal an ordinary old magician man (who resembles Professor Marvel) pulling levers and speaking into a microphone -- the so-called wizard, as the Scarecrow says, is \"a humbug\". He is abashed and apologetic, but quickly finds ways to help Dorothy's friends via tokens which grant their wishes: a diploma for the Scarecrow, a medal of valor for the Lion, and a testimonial heart-shaped watch for the Tin Man. Then he reveals that he is from Kansas himself and came to Oz in a hot-air balloon, in which he proposes to take Dorothy home.\nThe Wizard appoints the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion rulers of Oz in his absence. Just as the balloon is about to take off Toto runs after a cat and Dorothy follows him. Unable to stop, the wizard leaves without Dorothy. But Glinda appears and explains that Dorothy has always had the power to get home; Glinda did not tell her before because Dorothy would not have believed it. Bidding her friends a tearful good-bye, Dorothy taps her heels together three times, repeats \"There's no place like home,\" and the Ruby Slippers teleport both her and Toto back to Kansas.\nDorothy wakes up in her own bed with a washcloth on her head as Auntie Em and Uncle Henry fuss over her. Professor Marvel and the farmhands Hunk (\nRay Bolger\nagain), Hickory (\nJack Haley\nagain), and Ezekiel (\nBert Lahr\nagain) stop by to see how she is doing. She raises indulgent laughter when she tells them about Oz and tells them that she had seen them there, but she is so happy to be home she does not mind that they do not believe her. Miss Gulch is never mentioned again.",

                "This film predates my birth by 19 years, so I've seen it as a child when it was an annual event on network TV, stretched out to hours in length, believably due to commercials and maybe not so believably today due to the network hosting and talking about the film a little during breaks.Today at age 55, when it shows up on Turner Classic Movies, even though I have in my possession the deluxe \"Wizard of Oz DVD Set and Museum in a Box\", I'll still stop and watch it from whatever point I catch it to the end. Having the advantage of having seen it at all ages I can truly say that it has enough fantasy and whimsy and spectacle to keep the interest of children without being inane so that adults cannot appreciate it too. I think in all of filmdom only Walt Disney in Walt's time with his animated features and Pixar in modern times have been able to strike that balance. Even \"Star Wars\" has lost a step or two in the 36 years since its release.Wizard of Oz has the universal themes of the value of friendship and family, of how many of us have strengths and virtues inside of us we'll never believe we have until tested, and how many powerful people are literally all hot air. \"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain\" is practically a slogan of American politics as I am writing this in the year 2013. Then there is beautiful Judy Garland when her exterior still matched her voice, before the studio system chewed her up and literally spit her out. She was never more lovely than she is right here. You'd never believe Billie Burke as the good witch Glenda is 55 years old. You'd never believe that Margaret Hamilton as The Bad Witch is only 37. I remember seeing her on a daytime commercial in the 1960's as a child and thinking \"Isn't she dead yet?\" There is maybe one aspect of this film that is uniquely pre-WWII. The theme of the film - \"Never look for anything if you can't find it in your own backyard\" is a motto for the isolationist years between the wars that would be left behind in only a couple of years when it became apparent that the U.S. would have to confront the evil expansionist powers growing on both sides of the globe. It is perhaps a unique snapshot in time in that regard only. It also shows the best the studio system could produce in that fabled year of 1939 when it was at the height of its power.Forgive me for yammering on about a film that has been reviewed hundreds of times, but this one will always have a special place in my heart and my memory.",

                "Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, Dorothy's oddball Oz friends, \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\", and the rest of this fine production of \"The Wizard of Oz\" have lost little of their magic over the years. While it has become oddly fashionable in recent years to deride this kind of classic, innocent fantasy, the movie itself has aged very well, and it is likely to retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.There's no doubt that part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from them being such old friends to so many cinema fans, but there are also good reasons why they have endured for so long, and have been able to hold up even after becoming so familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise, the 'Oz' characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting, but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy's friends want?The adaptation from the original story is done quite well, making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today's computer imagery, but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning, and even now, in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.The popular story has also been used for a number of more recent adaptations, and some of them have had some good points of their own. But this Wizard remains by far the most wonderful of the versions of the classic tale.",

                "Dorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.The Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that there not only is no place like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn't, for at times it's a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from being of an excellent standard. Crucially, though, any misgivings are quickly erased due to the utter wonder of it all, you see this is because the film has a beguiling ability to transport everybody who is watching it and slot them into OZ alongside Dorothy.The Wizard Of Oz appeals (and caters) to every demographic and pretty much any age group, we have adventure, the meeting of new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course the total crux point of homely values. The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 80 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being. Be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it's a film that shouldn't be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it's a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.The film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was. Myself as a lump of waning middle aged machismo, has no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as though I'm being sent spinning into another world, that's the power of the piece, because as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I'm in hook line and sinker.There are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being the original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag!One of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy's Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then also see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 10/10 movie. And then some.",

                "The most difficult thing about reviewing The Wizard of Oz is finding something to say about it that doesn't begin with \"the best.\" It's hard to argue that this isn't a strong contender for the greatest movie of all time. Navel-gazing dramas about the human condition are fine, and I know most critics' lists would give preference to those sorts of films, but this movie has a little bit of everything and is easily among the most perfect films ever made. It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grown-up. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has appeal for every open-hearted person out there. It's full of iconic lines, songs, characters, and moments. It's had a cultural impact few films do. So many things from the film have made their way into our everyday lives and language. If I had to single out one thing about it I love more than the memorable characters played by an ideal cast, exuberant Arlen & Harburg songs, delightful story, and beautiful sets, costumes, and matte painting backdrops, it would be the vibrant and rich Technicolor. It's such a gorgeous looking movie. Funny, sentimental, sincere -- it's a masterpiece that I've been in love with since I was a little kid. I've never grown tired of it and I hope I never do.",

Judy Garland is wonderful as Dorothy, bringing a sense of vulnerability and sadness to the role, making Over The Rainbow more poignant than it already was. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are really entertaining as her three friends. Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins were great fun too. The wicked witch of the west scared the life out of me here and still does, and even Frank Morgan does 5 roles to great comical effect. The songs are just fabulous, and so is the cinematography and the stunning scenery. True, the film isn't completely faithful to the book, but why does it have to be? If I had one minor drawback, it would be the singing voice of the Lion, but apart from that, this movie is a must-see! 10/10. Bethany Cox",

                "Even with the advance of special effects there will never be a movie as honest and as true to its heart as THE WIZARD OF OZ, with the exception of THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. But since the latter is too new, it can't be compared to the former. Everyone at one point of their lives, especially as children, has seen this film and has experienced the emotions that Dorothy experienced, the terror of entering the Wicked Witch's lair, her transition from little girl to wise young woman, and this incredible world that L. Frank Baum created and Hollywood perfected.What makes a great movie? The experience that you are watching it for the very first time, whether you were seven years old or an adult living in an adult world. This film is one of those. Even when as an adult I can see some of the cracks peeking through and some lapses in continuity, who cares? The tornado ripping through the cornfields is as real as the real ones I have seen even though is was really muslin. The moment that the sepia-tones from the Kansas segment peel away and Dorothy opens the door of her house and I saw the bright colors of Oz I knew I was there. The story had enveloped me now, as it had did back then. In my world, this is an utterly, fantastic film.And what is Oz, by the way? Well, from a little girl (and the child in all of us), it's that place where our imagination runs wild, where everything is perfect, where there is no tomorrow and a yellow brick road will take us to that perfect place filled with song. It's that place where we feel we will belong, and who as a child didn't feel like we were out of place? Notice I repeat the word 'place' because this is so much about placement, places, our place and therefore, our own self-expression, our own sense of self. Who hasn't wanted to \"seek a place of one's own' where light and love prevailed only to return back to where we came from, stronger and wiser? Its message is so universal. Truly, there is no place like home.Timing is crucial for the symbolic success of this movie as well. Still in the middle of the Depression years, when unemployment was at an all time high, it focuses not just on the harshness of keeping a farm, but then throwing a parent-less girl into a strange land who finds a foster mother of sorts who would tell her that the way back home would not be an easy one. Glinda the Good represents this character, the same way, the Wicked Witch of the West represents the darker forces that watch her every move and aggressively try to trip her up. This is quite a lot on the shoulders of a little girl, and having Judy Garland -- not yet the major star but just on the brink of becoming one -- play Dorothy Gale has become casting history. In 1939 she was about seventeen, fresh-faced, innocent and vulnerable: she is Dorothy, and we can't imagine anyone else, not even nearly 70 years later.And speaking of casting, it was genius to have the actors playing Dorothy's friends and enemies in Kansas also show up in Oz. Since the movie is so much like a dream, it's more than logical: many people in our lives sometimes show up in dreams -- it's even in books about dreams. That they also represent that which not only they, but Dorothy most of all, lacks -- courage, love, and wisdom -- makes their appearances even more intrinsic to the story, so when they grow as characters, so do we, and of course, so does Dorothy.THE WIZARD OF OZ is timeless. So simple, so honest, but so deep in its messages about love and self-discovery. All of the actors including the veteran Billie Burke would be remembered the most for their roles here more than any other movie. The set direction is made to look as close to a storybook; all that is missing are the page frames. There isn't a false move here, and all those back-stories... well, their okay to read but for the cinema lover looking for magic, it's all here, in about two hours of pure entertainment.",

                "I was born the same year the movie came out, but only caught up with it the other night, mainly because musicals are not my usual movie fare. So what's left to say after 500+ reviews. I was most impressed by the art and set direction. Too bad they didn't win Oscars. The sets were so imaginative and well done, from poppy fields to enchanted woods to yellow brick road. For once, MGM's habit of over-producing what's on screen really paid off with an appropriately lavish scale. The effects are simply breathtaking, but I can also detect the nightmarish visuals that go beyond the demonic Witch of the West. So I can see why kids would be both mesmerized and unsettled by the fantastic adventures.I also have to say that Garland was wonderful as Dorothy, though I've never been a particular fan. Plus, her captivating rendition of Rainbow deserves to top the all-time movie charts. All in all, I'm sorry it took me so long to catch up. It's really hard to believe that so many cooks (writers & directors) didn't spoil the outcome.

                "I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children. The movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it, but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds. Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that, and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.",

                "Where to begin? MGM's elaborate adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ not only became an institution among itself (and practically defined the concept of modern popular culture), but is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film, and director Victor Fleming (along with countless other behind-the-scenes technicians) craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects (the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI), witty dialogue, and eye-popping Technicolor, THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a once-in-a-lifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.The cast could not be improved upon. The quivery-voiced, solemn-faced Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, the little lost farm girl on the road to Oz, clutching her beloved Toto (impressively portrayed himself by the female canine performer Terry, the terrier). It seems inconceivable that MGM had originally wished to cast Shirley Temple in the role, as Temple's doe-eyed, cutesy-voiced shtick would have been a catastrophic ill-fit for the tone of this picture. Conversely, Garland is perhaps the screen's quintessential woman/child; always seemingly just one step away from reaching full emotional maturity. It is her sadness that transfixes viewers to the screen, the exact same quality that made the film's most memorable Harold Arlen/E. Y. Harburg number \"Over the Rainbow\" into one of the most exquisite marriages between artist and song ever to be recorded.The remainder of the cast is similarly exceptional, many of whom perform perfectly even under the most debilitating make-up and costumes. Frank Morgan is marvelously versatile in no less than five roles, the insanely energetic Bert Lahr mugs brilliantly, the handsome Jack Haley swoons sweetly, Billie Burke lends the film an ornate ethereality, and Ray Bolger's gravity-defying physical presence nearly steals the entire picture on several occasions. Perhaps most notable is former schoolteacher Margaret Hamilton's transformation into the wickedest of wicked witches, which certainly remains among the vilest and most terrifying portrayals of full-throttle evil ever to be seen. No matter how it is analyzed, scrutinized, or satirized, the 1939 production of THE WIZARD OF OZ is a top-notch example of how to turn a great story into a fabulous, milestone of a film.",

Judy Garland plays Dorothy, a farm girl who, in the midst of a tornado, is spirited away over the rainbow to the glorious land of Oz. She is greeted by numerous Munchkins after her house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East. This angers the Wicked Witch of the West who demands the ruby slippers, which have appeared on Dorothy's feet. To return to Kansas she must follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and seek help from the wizard. On the way she encounters a scarecrow who needs a brain, a tin man who needs a heart, and a cowardly lion who needs courage. Skillfully directed by Victor Fleming whose luck had him direct this film and Gone With the Wind the same year. Garland graces the screen with her innocence and beautiful singing voice that belts out \"Over the Rainbow.\" Margaret Hamilton plays the menacing wicked witch whose defeat is one of the great scenes due to its simplicity. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are wonderfully cast as Dorothy's companions. Margaret Hamilton gives a menacing performance as the Wicked Witch of the west. It regards important things taken for granted. Triumphant visual wonder that renders that \"you're not in Kansas anymore.\" Score: 10 / 10",

                "Released in 1939, \"The Wizard of Oz\" is a classic American film that had a modest start. After its release, and for many years, it was viewed as an entertaining film but not as a great film. When I was a child, it aired on network TV once a year, around Thanksgiving. Whole families would gather around their sets for this special annual viewing.Later, when films became more widely available, its reputation seemed to grow and one would find it included in the lists of \"best\" films. Personally, I have always loved \"The Wizard of Oz\". I have seen it so many times, I practically know it frame by frame, as I am sure many others do.Here are some of the reasons this film should be considered great and powerful:1. The Beginning: The first part of the film, which is filmed in rich sepia tones, includes comedy, suspense, drama, music, and the establishment of all main characters.2. The tornado: The special effects used to create the menacing tornado are spectacular. It is still an emotionally charged element, despite our exposure to the spectacles of modern CGI.3. The song: \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" is regarded as one of the best film songs of all time. The film almost starred Shirley Temple and MGM wanted to cut the song, so we should consider ourselves lucky.4. Judy Garland: The use of Judy Garland to play the role of Dorothy Gale added a sense of maturity to the role and to the movie in general. Her vocal talents elevated the film.5. Frank Morgan: First introduced in the film as Professor Marvel, Frank Morgan's talents are used in a clever way through his various characters.6. The use of color: When Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland, the screen erupts in color. It has various symbolic uses, but mostly it delineates between the world Dorothy is from and a new world where the rules are unknown.7. The Munchkins: The strangeness of the new world and a considerable amount of charm are enhanced by this troupe and their voices.8. The Yellow Brick Road: Not the literal road, but what it represents--an adventure of possibilities, where heroes are tested.9. Serendipity: The fortunate way the elements of this film came together (Judy Garland vs. Shirley Temple, Ray Bolger vs. Buddy Ebsen, the use of the \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\", etc.)10. The Wizard: The use of screen projection, smoke and sound produced a scary Wizard that contrasted sharply with the beneficent image suggested to Dorothy by Glinda and the Munchkins.11. The musical score in general. The production is generously endowed with some magical musical numbers.12. The supporting cast: Dorothy's fellow travelers seem perfectly cast to us now, so iconic are their characterizations.13. The Witch: One of the great villains in film history, surrounded by her henchmen and her minions (the flying monkeys, terrors in their own right).14. The script: The story is engaging. It is also responsible for a slew of iconic quotes. My favorite is \"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!\"15. The director: Victor Fleming's vision produced a delightful film that can be enjoyed over and over. When we consider that he also is credited with directing \"Gone with the Wind\" in the same year--amazing!",

                "People talk about The Wizard of Oz as a backdrop to their lives; and how true that is. I just saw it again, DVD, for the first time in--gosh!--20 years. There was a little art house in Lansing Michigan USA that ran it back then, on the popular premise that there's nothing like TWoO on \"the big screen.\" That's the last time I'd seen it, 'til today.I guess the part that \"gets\" me about the movie is how the writers made it pretty plain that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion really already had what they thought they were missing; that their respective problems were in misapprehending their own complete natures. That's a powerful statement for many of us. I found myself most touched in scenes where the Scarecrow was showing wisdom, the Tin Man feeling deeply (\"...when I think of Dorothy in that awful place...\"), and the Lion...well, maybe accomplishing this effect was harder in his case...what *is* true courage?Anyway, if you're reading this here, you must be a movie weenie, and you've no doubt already seen the movie, so I'm not going to recite the usual \"go see this movie\" mantra.I was just very touching to see this movie again, at this phase in my life.I will mention a few more things about how I now see this movie as a \"growed up\" (I'm almost 50): It's interesting how you can see the production values of the time; the lot sets and special effects and so forth. This movie is a powerful example of how a good story overcomes limited means in other areas.People who look back with disdain on the low-tech chintz of old movies can see in TWoO the magic ingredient; narrative solidity. And I'm not a pollyanna about this: I'm sure the underlying reality behind its making is rife with horror stories of expert disagreement, rewrites, discarding, jerryrigging, and the rest of it. But in the end, something like narrative love won out; and that's the important thing.Oh: And having Harold Arlen write the music was good luck indeed. And orchestrations which cleverly appropriated very tasty new ideas in composition (polymodalism, non-standard phrasings, etc.) didn't hurt, either!Geez, this movie is such a little universe....I'd better stop here.",

                "In the fall of 2006, my husband and I saw a screening \"The Wizard of Oz\" that had a full orchestra providing the soundtrack. Never in my life had I seen a more eclectic audience: there were families with little children, adults who came alone (one woman was dressed as Glinda), teens and college students, even couples who had to have been in their '90s. Not to gush, but it's really a testimonial to \"Oz\"'s legacy that it can appeal to every generation, to every age. Like hot chocolate or Mickey Mouse T-shirts, \"The Wizard of Oz\" is something you never have to worry about being too old for. There is something so comforting about the familiar story of farm girl Dorothy's journey through the strange but wonderful land of Oz, and yet it remains a wonder to behold. I still get excited when Dorothy steps out her sepia-toned world of Kansas into the Technicolor Munchkinland, even though I learned ages ago how the trick was done. I'm still overjoyed when Dorothy makes another odd yet loyal friend along her journey (hmmm, a nice message of tolerance, too!). I still cry when Dorothy bids her friends farewell (Jack Haley in particular breaks my heart). I just want to yell at the screen, \"no! Forget boring old Kansas, stay in Oz!\"Not only is \"The Wizard of Oz\" a charming, addictive classic, but it's one of the best-cast films ever. Putty-limbed Ray Bolger (\"Some people without brains do and AWFUL lot of talking, don't they?\"), over-the-top Bert Lahr (I haven't any courage at all, I even scare myself!\"), and boyishly charming Jack Haley (\"Now I know I have a heart, 'cause it's breaking.\") are pitch-perfect in their respective roles as the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man. All three were vaudeville vets, and they infuse their roles with both theatrical shtick and warmth. Billie Burke is memorably twittery yet poised as Glinda the Good Witch, and who can possibly forget Margaret Hamilton's cackling, gleefully evil performance as the Wicked Witch of the West? Hamiltion's iconic, villainous image is so emblazoned in our minds, that it's easy to forget she was a former kindergarten teacher and future animal rights activist! As superb as the cast is, however, \"The Wizard of Oz\" belongs to the young Judy Garland. Garland makes Dorothy a very real character that we can all relate too, whereas any other actress would have made her one-note and whiny. She believably plays an ordinary girl in an extraordinary place, her lovely brown eyes wide with awe and wonder. And that singing voice! Long before Garland's voice became tinged with tremulous desperation due to age and hard living, the true beauty and purity of her voice comes through in \"Oz\". Garland sings \"Over the Rainbow\" so simply, without a trace of theatrics, and you're swept away just the same. It's spellbinding, seeing someone so young have the presence and talent to hold a movie in the palm of her hand. \"The Wizard of Oz\" will remain the ultimate escapist classic for generations to come, and it will always be one of my favorites. It's comforting, familiar, why... it's just like home.",

This is a wonderful film for the whole family. Who wouldn't want to take a journey to the magical land of Oz?I think that it is terrific how well this movie has held up over the years. It's going on sixty-two years since it was first released and yet, it is timeless. It is great to look back on a film that was made in the thirties, and compare it to the movies made in this day and age. This is a film that will just be something that stays around forever. The Wizard of Oz is enjoyable for people of all ages. Everything about it brings a smile to my face. Wouldn't it be wonderful to just magically be transported to a land of talking trees and little munchkins? Of course it would be. The flying monkeys, a talking lion, the astounding ruby slippers, and everything else adds a special kind of magic to the screen.The atmosphere and setting is magnificent. This is one of the things that makes the film so stunning. Anyway, the forest, the witch's castle, and even the farm is really well laid out.I don't think that the casting could have been done any better. Judy Garland shines as the innocent Kansas girl. Her dancing and singing just brightens the whole story up. The lion, tin man, and scarecrow perform amazingly also. Everyone involved down to the littlest munchkin acts so well.\nEven though this is a movie for everyone, it is categorized as a children's flick. The writing is good with very simple lines and problems, but slightly complex so we're not falling asleep of boredom. What's left to say? Other things like the wardrobe, special effects, musical talents, and even the famous yellow brick road, are so well put together. Oz gives us an idea of what an almost perfect world would be like. No matter how old this movie becomes and we still look back on it, we'll still be able to enjoy at least one thoughtful movie. Classics never die. (Hence the name.)",

                "For my 2000th review, I felt it would be appropriate to visit the film that I saw 20 times by the time I was 20. Between countless network T.V. viewings (on my grandparent's old T.V. where everything was green, even the black and white Kansas sequences), several big screen visits, hundreds of playings of it at the video store I worked at for 10 years and numerous video covers and different DVD releases, this film has never escaped our culture, and thus my life. My favorite VHS cover was the one in red which focused on the witch and her crystal ball, but that was out of print almost immediately after its release, while the one copy I owned was the blue \"50th Anniversary\" special edition which came with a ton of extras.While throughout grade school, I was obsessed, not only with the film, but the book too, I made a point of seeing it every time network T.V. aired it. When I first discovered it on video, I was thrilled to be able to see it without commercials and certainly without edits. I was also surprised to find out how much was edited from the film, and like Angela Lansbury quoted about the film in her documentary on its filming, \"How long is too long?\". Certainly, I would have loved to see the filmed footage of \"The Jitterbug\" rather than the home movies, but it is obvious from what I have seen that it takes away from the flow of the completed film. What would have been more interesting was the lavish sequence (seen briefly in one of the re-release trailers) of Dorothy and her friend's return from the witches' castle.Of course, the star-making performance of Judy Garland is the heart and soul of this breathtaking fantasy, often imitated but never surpassed. She's a bit busty for the role of the pre-teen Dorothy, but her sincerity is magnetic. There was a genius behind all her madness and as sorry as you can feel for her because of all her woes, you can't feel sorry for the artist who to this day strikes a cord in non-fans, not to mention those of us who consider her the single greatest female performer of all times.There's no better supporting cast (although much of the roles were initially mentioned for other actors), with Ray Bolger an absolute rubbery delight as the Scarecrow, Jack Haley tender and gentle to the max as the Tin Man, and Bert Lahr a blubbering gem as the Cowardly Lion. No good witch was more glamorous than Billie Burke's Glinda (even all the blonde starlets in Broadway's \"Wicked\"), and for pure fright, no wicked witch was scarier than Margaret Hamilton's. I became a huge fan of this wonderful character actress as a child, and to this day, I delight in finding works of hers I hadn't seen yet. Hamilton's Miss Gulch reminds me of the delightfully nosy neighbors of my childhood, and to see her in the same outfit the year later sticking her nose up to W.C. Fields' in \"My Little Chickadee\" was a comic treat.While Fields was mentioned as a candidate for the role of the wizard, it was Frank Morgan, a stuttering gem of a comical character actor who ended up with the role. He appears in an assortment of other roles, beginning in the Kansas sequence, and later as the doorman of Oz and the doorman to the wizard, all disguised to make you think that he's actually another character, which is doubtful. Hamilton obviously is not only Miss Gulch and the Western Witch, but in the brief guise of the Eastern Witch as well. Of course, in \"Wicked\", Nessarose is a lot more beautiful than her sister, only made ugly in spirit by her change in character which didn't ring true.In smaller roles, Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick as Uncle Henry and Auntie Em offer wise, if distant, support to Judy Garland's Dorothy, with Grapewin very funny as he reluctantly greets the Gulch Woman and Blandick downright hysterical as she tells her off. Toto is an adorable pooch, and I long for a spoof of him getting his revenge on Gulch by biting her in the tush before jumping out of the basket. So as I reflect in my journal of my journey down the yellow brick road, I must call it a lifetime of great and powerful entertainment where every character has become an important part of my child-like heart in my transition to find my own land of Oz.",

With all these elements, it's comforting that the film lost against a worthy adversary, the iconic \"Gone with the Wind\" from the same director. God, if there ever was a year where film-making triumphed, it's 1939, and the throne of Hollywood undoubtedly belonged to Victor Fleming.\"The Wizard of Oz\" is both a spectacular milestone for its first use of colors and groundbreaking visual effects and a timeless classic in the way it touched the heart of children from many generations, all over the world. It's fascinating how these two aspects drive the film's paradoxical nature as the ultimate escapism, plunging us in the dreamlike Technicolor vision of the enchanted land of Oz, yet concluding with the immortal \"There's no place like home\". \"Oz\" captures through the innate power and insecurity of childhood a very poignant contradiction that reminds us how we used to dream of such places 'over the rainbow' and still were deeply rooted to our home, our family. And Kansas, with its sepia-like simplicity is Dorothy's home and we couldn't be happier for her when she was finally back.But as a set-up to this powerful finale, the whole film is a miraculous journey into a magical world where a group of friends will try to find the only person whose power could fulfill their wishes. Dorothy wants to go home, because she left her aunt worried after a frightening tornado destroyed the farm, the Scarecrow wants to have a brain, the Tin Man, a heart and needless to say what the Cowardly Lion wants. We all can identify with Dorothy or her friends because each one remains true to one of the many emotions that inhabit childhood, fear, awkwardness, joy, sadness, homesickness etc. And watching these three adult actors and an adolescent Judy Garland taking their roles with such dedication is the best tribute to the good old days' innocence. Those were the days ruled by Walt Disney and MGM's roaring lion, when people went to the movie theaters to escape, to dream \u0085 an even sadder desire when put in the tragic international context of the film.Speaking of my personal experience, I had \"The Wizard of Oz\" in mind long before watching the film, with the unforgettable image of Dorothy and her three friends walking along the \"We're off to see the Wizard\" song, one of these indelible shots in the history of film-making that invites us to re-enact them every once in a while. That's the secret of \"Oz\", which makes any attempt to summarize the film pointless. Any other fantasy film can be more spectacular or penetrating but its popularity might mostly rely on the story, on the way it ends. Take Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\", the whole significance of the film depends on the reception of the last act of the film, and kind of diminish the impact of the first scenes. In \"The Wizard of Oz\", it's all about characters, scenes, songs, quotes, each sequence is as valuable and impacting as another, and more than anything, each one conveys a valuable lesson about and for children.Whether it's about children's adoration for their pet animals (Dorothy's adventure starts because she wanted to protect her dog Toto from the evil Miss Gulch) or about the value of friendship in order to face the adversity of the adult world, an undeniable pedagogical value elevates \"Oz\" above all the other fantasy movies. It is, for once, not a coming-of-age, but a coming-to-realization story and a proud affirmation of the value of childhood in the way it intelligently mirrors our own memories of a time of misunderstanding, naivety, trust and fear and a perpetual leaning helping us to face the world, to accept it and moreover to accept ourselves (there's a subtle message about self-acceptance powerfully conveyed by the wizard, played by the jovial Frank Morgan). And the merit of these lessons is to be learned through action: Dorothy and her friends are never passive characters characters and that's crucial because it puts action as a necessary step before learning, and fear, not as a flaw, but a necessary step before learning about courage. \"The Wizard of Oz\" provides also through the wizard's character, the man 'behind the curtain', a lesson about naivety and how child's eyes can easily trust or be impressed. In a way, it illustrates the sad reality that all the adults aren't trustworthy. Of course, some of them can be really mean and the film wouldn't have been half the masterpiece it is without the scene stealing performance of Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, rightfully nominated #4 in the AFI Top 50 villains. The Witch happens to be a representation of Mrs. Gulch in Dorothy's dream, like most of the characters, including the three friends (farmhands in real-life) and the wizard \u0085 in a way, it helps us to keep in mind that Dorothy is only dreaming, which doesn't make her dream less impacting anyway.And bizarrely, as we forget it's all a dream, we cease to be marveled by the beauty of the cinematography and the special effects, forgetting that it was before CGI, before \"Star Wars\", that's the miracle of \"The Wizard of Oz\", and as a beautiful dream, its memory can be eternal",

I watched it when I was a little kid and loved it as much as anyone else in the film industry.

                "I just finished reading most of the 100+ IMDb reviews of \"Wizard of Oz.\" It is clear that the vast majority of reviewers rate this as one of the best films of all time, an evaluation I agree with. But there are a small few reviews which criticize it harshly. And some just ask simple questions. The following addresses this.SPOILER - First off, once you've seen the entire film you realize the whole visit to Oz was Dorothy's dream. During the storm a window frame blew into her bedroom and knocked her out. The house was not swept up by the tornado. When the storm passed, and everyone else came out of the storm cellar looking for Dorothy, they found her on her bed, unconscious. While she was unconscious she had the dream of going to Oz. All the strange people she met, all the strange places, were all things she imagined. It was all set up during the first 10 minutes or so, in conversations with her family members, and the fortune teller she met when she attempted to run away right before the storm.Why dream of going to Oz? Recall that Dorothy was being hassled by the wicked rich woman who wanted to kill her dog, and family members wouldn't give her the time to talk about anything. They were all too busy. She sang about finding a place \"over the rainbow\" where everything would be wonderful. When we go to sleep with a lot on our mind, we often have very vivid dreams about it. Her dream of Oz was the playing out of her imaginary place over the rainbow. But her dream eventually made her realize that such a place was not where happiness resided, but instead within her and her family, \"there's no place like home.\" And then, she woke up.So, do all of us dream too?  Sure we do, if we are normal. Do all things in our dreams make sense once we wake up?  Of course not. Then why should we expect anything different of Dorothy's dream? Why didn't the good witch tell her early on she could get back to Kansas by clicking her heels? Because there was no good witch. It was all part of Dorothy's dream, therefore she would have to get angry at herself. Now, do you see the absurdity in criticizing any part of the movie's plot? Or talking of \"plot holes?\" Dreams are dreams, and are not expected to bear a strong relationship to reality.I don't believe everyone should consider \"Wizard of Oz\" a great film. Tastes differ. I don't think \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"Lord of the Rings\" are great films. But I do believe everyone should realize when certain comments just don't make sense. Because it was a dream, the story cannot have plot holes. Why could the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion talk? Because it was a dream. The dream of a 15-year-old girl.  Accept that, and any questions you may have suddenly make perfect sense.",

            "Lt. John Dunbar is dubbed a hero after he accidentally leads Union troops to a victory during the Civil War. He requests a position on the western frontier, but finds it deserted. He soon finds out he is not alone, but meets a wolf he dubs &quot;Two-socks&quot; and a curious Sioux tribe. Dunbar quickly makes friends with the tribe, and discovers a white woman who was raised by the Sioux tribe. He gradually earns the respect of these native people, and they learn from each other and befriend each other.",

Having observed him, they give the name Dances With Wolves. Soon he is a welcomed member of the tribe and falls in love with a white woman who has been raised in the tribe. Tragedy results when Union soldiers arrive with designs on the land.",

Not soon after, the frontier becomes the frontier no more, and as the army advances on the plains, John must make a decision that will not only affect him, but also the lives of the natives he now calls his people."

        "synopsis": "During a US Civil War battle in Tennessee, Union Army Officer Lieutenant John J. Dunbar (\nKevin Costner\n) learns that his injured leg is to be amputated. Seeing the plight of fellow soldiers with amputated legs, Dunbar refuses amputation and steals a nearby horse. He attempts suicide by riding a horse across the line of fire, between the opposing Union and Confederate positions, who have been in a stalemate for days. His action has the unexpected effect of rallying his comrades, who storm the distracted Confederates and win the battle. After the ensuing battle, an experienced general's surgeon saves Dunbar's leg. The commanding officer recognizes Dunbar as a hero and gives him Cisco, the horse who carried him in battle, and offers Dunbar his choice of posting.\nDunbar, anxious to see the American frontier before it disappears due to mass settlement from the East, requests transfer west. After meeting with Major Fambrough (\nMaury Chaykin\n), who has slipped into delusions of grandeur (apparently believing he is a king and Dunbar a medieval knight), he is paired with a drayage teamster named Timmons (\nRobert Pastorelli\n), who conveys Dunbar to his post. Immediately after Dunbar meets leaves with Timmons, Fambrough commits suicide with his pistol.\nAfter a scenic journey, Dunbar and Timmons arrive with fresh supplies at the desolate Fort Sedgwick, finding it deserted except for a lone wolf that Dunbar later befriends and dubs Two Socks, because of the coloring of its front legs. Dunbar, while waiting for reinforcements to arrive, sets about bringing order the deserted post, left in complete disarray by its previous occupants. Meanwhile, Timmons, while returning to their point of departure, is ambushed by Pawnee Indians and scalped. Timmons' death and the suicide of the major who sent them there prevents Union officers from knowing of Dunbar's assignment to the post, effectively isolating Dunbar. Dunbar remains unaware of the full situation and its implications. He notes in his journal how strange it is that no more soldiers join him at the post.\nDunbar initially encounters Sioux neighbors when the tribe's medicine man, Kicking Bird (\nGraham Greene\n), happens upon the fort while Dunbar bathes out of sight, and, assuming it abandoned, attempts to capture Cisco. After a naked Dunbar scares off Kicking Bird, he is confronted by an aggressive warrior named Wind in His Hair (\nRodney A. Grant\n), who declares that he is not scared of the white man. Wind in His Hair and his compatriots' attempt to capture Cisco ends in failure when the horse throws off his would-be thief. Eventually, Dunbar establishes a rapport with Kicking Bird, but the language barrier frustrates them. Believing that he should take the initiative in establishing communication with the tribe, Dunbar dresses himself in his Army uniform and rides out to meet them. On the way, Dunbar interrupts the suicide attempt of Stands With A Fist (\nMary McDonnell\n), a white woman captured by the tribe as a child and recently widowed. Eventually Kicking Bird and Wind in His Hair visit Dunbar at the fort and realize that the lieutenant wants to know where to find herds of buffalo, the first word that they share. Dunbar finds himself drawn to the lifestyle and customs of the tribe, and becomes a hero among the Sioux and accepted as an honorary member of the tribe after he helps them locate a migrating herd of buffalo, which they depend upon as a source of food, material, and clothing.\nDunbar further helps defend the settlement against a Pawnee raiding party, providing the Sioux warriors with surplus rifles and ammunition which he'd buried near the fort. He eventually is accepted as a full member of the tribe. After members of the tribe witness him playing with Two Socks, he is named Sugm\u00e1nitu Taka Ob'wahi (\"Dances with Wolves\"; ugm\u00e1nitu Taka means large coyote, the Lakota word for wolf). Dunbar falls in love with Stands With A Fist, a relationship forbidden by the recent death of her husband in battle but consummated in secret. The two eventually win the approval of Kicking Bird, who takes on the role of her father, and marry. Dunbar subsequently spends more time living with the tribe than manning his post at Fort Sedgwick. Wind In His Hair, his last rival, acknowledges him as a friend.\nDunbar's idyll ends when he tells Kicking Bird that white men will continue to invade their land in \"numbers like the stars.\" They tell Chief Ten Bears (\nFloyd 'Red Crow' Westerman\n), who shows them a Conquistador's helmet that had been in his family for generations. The chief decides it is time to move the village to its winter camp. As the packing finishes, Dunbar realizes that his journal, left behind at the deserted fort, is a blueprint for finding the tribe, revealing that he knows far too much about their ways. Wearing Indian clothing, he returns to Fort Sedgwick to retrieve the journal but finds it is has suddenly been occupied by newly arrived Army troops. They see Dunbar and initially assuming he is an Indian, kill his horse Cisco and capture Dunbar.\nWhen they recognize Dunbar as a white man, they treat him as a deserter, punishable by death. Dunbar tells Lt. Elgin (\nCharles Rocket\n) (whom Dunbar met earlier in Maj. Fambrough's office) that he has a journal containing his orders for his posting to Fort Sedgwick. Spivey (\nTony Pierce\n), one of the first soldiers to arrive at the fort, denies the existence of the journal, which he had found and has in his pocket. After further beating, Dunbar declares in the Lakota language that his name is Dances With Wolves. Army officers and a few troops set off to deliver Dunbar to Fort Hayes for execution. When they happen upon Two Socks, they shoot at the wolf, who refuses to leave Dunbar. Despite his attempts to intervene, Two Socks is fatally wounded, Dunbar is hit in the head again and the convoy moves off.\nSoon after, Wind In His Hair and other warriors from the tribe attack the column of men, rescuing Dunbar. Smiles A Lot (\nNathan Lee Chasing His Horse\n) retrieves Dunbar's journal floating in a stream. After returning to the winter camp, Dunbar realizes that as a deserter and fugitive, he will continue to draw the unwelcome attention of the Army and endanger the welfare of the tribe if he stays with the Sioux. Under the protests of his Sioux friends, Dunbar decides that he must leave the tribe, saying he must speak to those who would listen. His wife decides to accompany him.\nAs Dances With Wolves and Stands With A Fist leave the camp, Wind In His Hair cries out that Dances with Wolves will always be his friend, a remembrance of their first confrontation. Shortly afterward, a column of cavalry and Pawnee army scouts arrive to find their former camp site empty.",

                "It's hard to think of blockbuster films that portray Native Americans as well as this one does. They are human beings here, with different personalities, intelligence, dignity, culture, and humor. The fact that a major Hollywood film had a good portion of its dialogue spoken in Lakota, subtitled in English, is fantastic. The portrayal of white cruelty, such as in the scene with rotting buffalo carcasses littering the prairie, invert the classic narrative, both in the genre of Westerns and in how history is often taught. The film identifies who the real savages were, and Kevin Costner should get a lot of credit for that.The film is of epic length, and by no means perfect. I would have preferred it without the love story, and for more centering on the native characters. The soundtrack is also intrusive, and there were many instances where I found myself thinking that the scene would have played more effectively had it been set to minimal audio. As for the criticism that it uses the 'white savior' trope, I didn't see it that way - if anything, Costner's character is the one saved, both spiritually and then physically as he's about to be hanged for treason. It's much more about the beauty of coexistence and of respecting other cultures, and how tragic the historical genocide was.The film is clearly a labor of love, and Costner took a lot of risks with it. The casting of Native actors quite honestly felt decades ahead of its time, and Graham Greene (Kicking Bird), Rodney A. Grant (Wind In His Hair), and Floyd Red Crow Westerman (Chief Ten Bears) are all wonderful. The cinematography on location mostly in South Dakota is simply stunning. However, what I love most about it is its heart, and how it shows simple appreciation for the Sioux people. \"They were a people so eager to laugh, so devoted to family, so dedicated to each other. The only word that comes to mind is harmony,\" the main character says. Would love to see more films like this, and from a native perspective. 31 years later, it's long overdue, but give Costner credit for what he accomplished in 1990.",

                "Dances With Wolves Is directed by Kevin Costner who also stars. It's adapted by Michael Blake from his own novel of the same name. Starring along side Costner are Graham Greene, Mary McDonnell & Rodney A. Grant. Dean Semler provides the cinematography & John Barry the musical score. Set during the American Civil War, the story tells how Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) goes to a military outpost on the American frontier, where confronted with alienation he befriends nature, the Lakota Indians and finds himself in the process.\"I had never known a people so eager to laugh, so devoted to family, so dedicated to each other. And the only word that came to mind was harmony\"The critics were rubbing their hands with glee, getting ready to tear Costner apart for what undoubtedly would be a failure. An epic Western movie made in 1990, had he not learnt from Heaven's Gate? It was long in production, and with only a $15/$22 million budget afforded it, word came that Costner had to put in $3 million of his own cash to aid production. It was beset with production delays as the problems mounted up with the weather, animal training and with action scenes taking up to three weeks to shoot, all contributing to the belief that it was doomed to failure. \"Kevin's Gate\" they cried, what's that? It's partially sub-titled too? Never work.Dances With Wolves went on to make $424 million in Worldwide theatre tickets alone. Heaven knows what the total would be if we added the VHS & DVD returns as well! Come Academy Award time the film won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture (making it the first Western to win the prestigious award since Cimarron in 1931) & Best Director. It was also nominated in five other categories with Costner up for Best Actor, Graham Greene for Best Supporting Actor & Mary McDonnell for Best Supporting Actress. It was, all told, a personal, artistic and commercial triumph for Costner. One can see him post Oscar night sitting there on his porch sipping sour mash and flipping the finger at all those critics who willed him to fail.Costner's movie is a simple tale, of that there is no arguing. But Dances With Wolves (the name given to Dunbar by the Sioux) is magnificently told, as enchanting a Western that has ever been made. It boasts everything needed to make a first class Oater. The story may be simple but it's rich on detail, the characters have real depth and it never sags, not even in its magnificent elongated directors cut that runs 236 minutes. The credit has to go to Costner, who in his debut as director lest we forget, has managed to blend everything together in the style of one of the old masters from the classic Western period. Every tonal avenue ventured down pays off handsome rewards, it all goes somewhere, awash with wistfulness, romanticism and elegiac poetry. The action sequences are expertly crafted, with a buffalo hunt particularly breath taking; no CGI here, the odd animatronic for a close encounter, but mainly the real deal, as are the wolves and the Lakota Sioux, too, who are played by Native Americans. Its humorous too, with its fun being intentional and aiding the flow of the friendships forming.As most Western fans will tell you, a lyrical horse opera needs great location work and a score to match. Thankfully Dances With Wolves has both, as both Semler & Barry produce work that picked up the Golden Baldy on Oscar night. Lensed predominantly in South Dakota around the Black Hills & Badlands regions, Semler infuses the film with natural landscapes that send the frontier bursting thru the screen, his framing explains things better than words can in this environment. While Barry's score, lifting nicely from A View To A Kill at times, is suitably grand, deft in touch for the main theme and blood pumping for the buffalo hunt and the Pawnee attacks. Acting wise the award nominations received for Costner, Greene & McDonnell were richly deserved. The boys are quiet and undemonstrative, at one with the essence of the story and infusing it with a sincerity so lacking in many epics. Playing Stands With A Fist, a white woman raised by the Sioux after her family were slaughtered when she was a child, McDonnell has to reach different character levels as the story unfolds, and she delivers emotional depth on every level. No nomination for Grant, but his work is top dollar also, his latter scenes with Costner really nail the shift in tone.There's some historical missteps that will no doubt annoy the purists, like I don't believe the Pawnee were the aggressors they are painted as here. While the central romance between Costner & McDonnell is delicate but not fully formed; tho it does improve in the directors cut. But it's hard to criticise little itches when such vision and ambition comes together as well as it does here. Structured with precision and showing respect for tradition, this is a movie about loving people for people lovers. And one can quite easily believe that some genre legends up in the sky were looking down and nodding approvingly. 10/10",

                "I haven't seen \"Dances With Wolves\" for years but recently rediscovered its brilliance. Released in 1990, the story involves Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner), a Civil War hero, singlehandedly manning a desolate prairie post in South Dakota. He becomes intrigued by his Native American neighbors, a small tribe of Lakota Sioux, and slowly develops good relations with them. He ultimately adopts a Sioux name - Dances With Wolves - and assimilates with the tribe. When the U.S. Army discovers his actions he is treated as a treasonous deserter. Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene have key roles. This is, simply put, filmmaking of the highest order. Everything magically works in this absolutely engaging 3-hour epic Western. The extended director's cut is an hour longer and most of the added material is worthwhile and fleshes out the characters more than the theatrical cut. I recommend watching the 3-hour version and, if you want more, check out the expanded version.Over the years I've heard some grumbling about the film's PC-influenced negative portrayal of whites in general and also its supposed romanticized portrayal of Indians as super-virtuous. Hence, before viewing the film again I was braced for the worst. After seeing it, I must say that most of these grumblings are hogwash. No kidding. Really, only a rigid white redneck \"patriot\" would take offense to this story (and, don't get me wrong, I'm patriotic but not mindlessly so). The film rings of authenticity and the characters are anything but one-dimensional. Want proof? (No major spoilers).The Pawnee are the first Indians the viewer encounters in the film and they are portrayed as completely hostile to whites and other NA tribes - so hostile that they'll kill a white person on sight without mercy. I'd say this is a negative, stereotypical portrayal of Indians, wouldn't you agree? Also, Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant) clearly states that the Sioux should kill Dunbar at the council meeting; I'm sure there were others who agreed with him but it was ultimately decided that killing Dunbar would likely cause more problems than solve.Not all white people are shown in a negative light; in fact, Dunbar himself - the film's protagonist - is white. What about the \"foul\" guy, Timmons, who escorts Dunbar to the abandoned fort? I've met people just like him. He's not portrayed as evil, but merely uncouth in dress and manners. Anyway, when Timmons gets savagely murdered by a band of Pawnee he begs over and over that the Indians not hurt his mules; his dying words are words of love (for his animals!). Also, when he says goodbye to Dunbar at the fort he says, \"Good luck, Lieutenant\" and you know he means it; the words show love and respect. Obviously this was a disgusting guy with a heart of gold. Again I know people just like him; it rings of authenticity.The story takes place during the Indian Wars where there's very little love & compassion of whites towards Indians and vice versa. The U.S. Army is there to do a job and, as usual, go by the book. Is this a negative portrayal or simply the way it was? The answer is obvious. Hence, most of the officers are not shown in a negative light but merely as military leaders carrying out their duty. Although some of the main enlisted soldiers come off as clueless sheetheads, again, the characters ring of true life. I met people just like 'em in the military.Besides, I repeat, not all Natives are depicted as virtuous. The Pawnee are obviously ruthless villains and quite a few Indians are shown helping the U.S. Army and are, therefore, traitors to their people.Is the small tribe of Lakota Sioux really super-virtuous? Is their lifestyle really a paradise? No, they're merely portrayed as real people living, pursuing happiness, uncertain about the amassing whites, fighting and persevering through hardships (like the winter camp).Is the massive annihilation of Bison (leaving their skinless carcasses to rot in the sun) a negative depiction of whites or just the way it was? Such people would likely shoot a wolf for the \"fun\" of it. Again, it smacks of reality.This is just a taste. Clearly, the people in the film are not as one-dimensional as some maintain. Neither is the movie as pro-Indian/anti-white as some insist. It's more complicated than that.As to the accuracy of the story itself, the fact is that many whites have \"gone injun\" and many Natives have assimilated with whites. The story explores the possibility of what would happen if a white man dropped all prejudices and tried to get along with some Sioux neighbors; and what if this small band of Natives was open and curious enough to accept him? Is it unlikely that this band would have an available good-looking white woman amongst them that Dunbar could fall in love with? Is there a bit of romanticization? Yes, but it IS a Hollywood movie, after all. Regardless, it's presented in a believable, compelling and captivating way.\"Dances\" is almost 20 years old but remains timeless like most great films; it is the definition of why films are made.The film was shot mostly in Western South Dakota with additional shooting in Jackson, Wyoming, as well as Nebraska and Kansas.

                "Many people regard a lot of films as \"top class\" but I always keep a little shelf in my mind for the films that I regard as the best films of all time - films that are simply timeless masterpieces. Welcome to the top of that shelf! There are certain criteria by which films are judged and greatness is only obtained when all the criteria are satisfied in full. Dances with Wolves is the greatest timeless masterpiece of cinema to date because it satisfies all these criteria: 1) Cinematography: the sweeping landscape photography of the Frontier combined with the subtle night-time photography earns top marks. Aside from Oscars for Cinematography and editing, it also won the ASC award for Outstanding achievement in Cinematography - as well as a host of other industry recognition awards. In short - the cinematography is breathtaking.2) Sound/Score: the score is one of the best ever written. Again, awards rained from the sky for magical and moving score that combined seamlessly with the film/story.3) Screenplay: The dialogue and plot is magnificent. The film does not fall into the common plot formulas found in other films that attempt to pass themselves off as epics. The story combines as both of celebration of life and a somber rumination of the history of mankind.There are comical moments, dramatic moments and tear-jerking moments - that all make their entry (and exit) into the story with flawless timing.4) The Acting: for all that has been said about Kevin Costner, this was the peak of his career and he played the role of John Dunbar to perfection. A relatively unknown band of actors gave magnificent, heart-felt and down-to-earth performances in support. It was actually refreshing to see an \"EPIC\" where the producers didn't feel the need to throw famous actors in with cameo roles to improve it marketability. As far as I was concerned, there were no weak links in the chain on the acting side of things. Kevin Costner certainly proved his worthiness as a director by getting the best out of the cast.5) The ONLY film in history to.... Have an extended (director's cut) version that was better than the original. Due to concerns about the length of the film, Dances with Wolves was stripped back to three hours. Some complained that it was still too long, but I thought that the film was patient - it included good relevant detail but managed to keep the story moving at a good pace. The director's cut added an hour to the cinematic release and was, without a doubt, better than the original. It somehow added more intrigue to the story and included many sobering insights into the destruction of the American Indian race.Over all, I regard it as the greatest most masterful epic of all time.",

                "It's hard for me to believe that fourteen years have passed since I first saw this movie. I was only ten at the time, and this was the first movie I ever saw that was both an eye-filling and a mind-filling spectacle. It was also one of only two theater-going experiences that I ever had with my late grandmother, and I always think of her when I watch this movie. It always takes me back to an earlier time in my life no matter how many times I see it.This is one movie that could only have been made in the post-Vietnam era, when Americans began to question the moral integrity of their country. How else to explain, in the opening sequence depicting the Civil War, the utter cynicism of the soldier who speaks with Costner's Dunbar character? Or Dunbar's later observation that \"there was no dark political objective\" to the Sioux battling the Pawnee? The scene in which Dunbar receives his orders from the mentally ill major also seems to speak of Vietnam, the point being I think that while an entire generation of young men was being cut down in the Civil War the West was being managed by those who were not fit for duty in the larger conflict. Maury Chaykin, in that one scene, gives one of the most memorable and haunting performances I've seen in any film.This movie's depiction of Native Americans is not nearly as politically correct as it may seem to those who watch it only once or only at a superficial level. In the very first scene depicting Indians, in fact, a Pawnee brave shoots one of the white characters full of arrows and then scalps him. The unrepentant villainy of Wes Studi's character, in particular, recalls the moral simplicity of countless earlier Westerns.Even the most sympathetic Indian character in the movie, Kicking Bird, is not kind to Dunbar merely to be friendly but because he believes he can get useful information out of the white soldier about the other whites who are encroaching on Sioux territory. The interaction between Dunbar and the Sioux is powerfully effective precisely because the Sioux remain true to themselves. They are not cartoonishly hostile like the Indians depicted in old Westerns, but they are not soft or na\u00efve either. While this movie draws its inspiration from American epics as diverse as The Birth of a Nation (1915) and The Searchers (1956), its originality lies not only in its respect for Native Americans but also in its intensely personal treatment of the main character. Few other three-hour epics (Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart come to mind ) have developed their protagonists as fully and dynamically as this movie develops Costner's Dunbar character.Even after fourteen years, the Dunbar character's arc, going from a suicidal soldier in the opening sequence to an adopted Sioux who in the final scenes puts the needs of his people ahead of his own, is still one of the most remarkable I've seen in any movie. Costner's performance won no awards that I know of, but it provides the movie's indispensably tight focus. He's completely convincing every step of the way, if a bit too clumsy and self-effacing at times, hitting his head in the dark and fainting after a confrontation in a heavy-handed attempt to demystify the West.Another quality this movie shares with The Searchers is that it associates the physical challenges of the frontier with the testing of the soul. The Dunbar character cleans out the watering hole at the fort because he refuses to lose his humanity like the men before him who abandoned the fort. Later he cannot decide whether he feel more or less at home in the presence of the Sioux, because he is struggling to remain true to himself even as he remains unsure of who he is.This movie probably disappoints viewers who are looking for sheer entertainment. It's a quiet, thoughtful story, and although there is action in it the focus is on how the action transforms the characters (particularly Dunbar) rather than on the action itself. You won't see any computer-generated comic-book characters in this movie, but you will see real people having real conversations, and you'll see Costner and costar Mary McDonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that you'll forget they're acting!If I could rate the musical score for this movie by itself I'd give it a perfect 10, because it's one of the best I've ever heard, able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove. It is sentimental without being schmaltzy, noble without being pretentious. Best of all, it captures the hesitant emotions of the story, the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust.Only this movie's extreme length works against its total success, particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is still long, but it's difficult to say what should have been left out of it.Some people still resent the fact that Costner won the Best Director Oscar over Scorcese's Goodfellas. There's no question that Scorcese is the better director, but I believe the direction of Dances With Wolves is better than that of Goodfellas. If you disagree with me try this test: imagine that Scorcese did this movie, and Costner directed Goodfellas. It's a question of which directing job is better, not which director is better.Unlike most epics, this movie ends exactly as it should. The final images, such as the journal floating down the river, the white man and the Native American speaking English to each other, and the brave shouting his farewell from the top of a cliff, are so beautiful and dreamlike that they manage to be both joyful and sad. This is a movie that looks into the very fabric of this country's past, and asks us to do the same.Rating: 10 (Good job, everybody.)",

                "People who say this movie is long and boring have obviously never sat through, oh, \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" \"Patton,\" \"Doctor Zhivago,\" \"The Godfather,\" \"Ran,\" \"Seven Samurai,\" or probably even \"Braveheart.\" Thank God that not every filmmaker believes that a car must explode every 10 seconds in order for his movie to be a success. Kevin Costner is one of those directors who prefers the long format. David Lean, Francis Coppola and Mel Gibson, to name a very few, also worked in that format, and produced lasting works of art that also packed theaters. There are plenty of options for people who don't like movies that take the time to build character, drama and suspense, movies like \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,\" \"Freddy Vs. Jason,\" and \"Weekend at Bernie's.\" I don't think any of those movies has ever been called \"boring,\" but they sure are crap cinema.Onward. \"Dances With Wolves\" thrilled audiences way back in 1990 and made so darn much money precisely because people had forgotten the pleasures of the long narrative, the Western genre, and movies that weren't special effects schlock-fests. It remains an inspiring and moving experience, especially on DVD, which preserves the movie's theatrical sound and picture quality.Costner's direction is first-rate. He's able to blend intimate drama with big, sprawling action that covers a huge canvas. I'm amazed at how smoothly the film segues from movement to movement -- action, alienation, suspense, social commentary, romance. Heck, Spielberg could take a lesson or two from this movie.He also gets great performances out of his cast. I don't think of these people as actors, but as the characters they play. That's a compliment not just to the actors themselves, but their director. And, yes, Costner is terrific as John Dunbar.Sure, it's easy to call \"Dances\" politically correct w/ reference to the Indians. But it also treats them as people and, better yet, as fictional characters whose lives are made part of a fascinating narrative. I just consider all the complaints about the politics of this movie as total hogwash.Finally, the movie is beautifully shot, has an unforgettable score, and is very well-written. I've never thought of \"Dances\" as a Western, but a modern action picture/character study that avoids all the boring cliches of the Western genre. Here is a movie that stands for something, means something, and deserves at least as much respect as some of the overrated dreck we've gotten saddled with lately.",

                "And he deserved those two Oscars he won for what he did on this movie. \"Dances With Wolves\" is definitely a classic epic motion picture, one that should not ever be remade or redone in any way. Because nothing and nobody will ever be able to do what Kevin Costner and his team did on this movie. It won seven Academy Awards and countless other ones, and it deserved every single one of those and much more.One of the main reasons why I loved \"Dances With Wolves\" is not just because it's a great movie, but because it's a very realistic movie. For the first time in a long time--or probably ever--we are shown what Native Americans were really like. Throughout history, Native Americans have been shown as barbaric savages with no intents but to murder and kill. But this movie shows that they were nothing at all like that, and it is correct. Native Americans were people, just like us. They only killed when they deemed it necessary: self-defense, protection of their land, beliefs, and so on. And it shows that just like us, they can hate, love, laugh, and cry. This movie also shows that Native American societies had both good and bad in them, no different than us.\"Dances With Wolves\" is over three hours long, especially in the extended addition, but like many other classics, if you have a good sense of what a good movie is, you won't even bother with the time. Because this movie is so epic and powerful and realistic, it's incredile. And it's remarkable what Kevin Costner did, seeing as how he had NEVER done a director's job until he made this movie. And he also played a very convincing lead role.Overall, this epic Western is a classic movie. And it should never be remade, because it was made in the right times and by the right man, so every aspect of it is perfect.",

                "Dances With Wolves is three hours long, but that is not long enough, it is so wonderful. It is set in the Civil War-era prairie, and it captures the encounter between a white man and a Sioux tribe. However, it is timeless. It is romantic, adventurous, active, comical, tragic, and educational. It demonstrates the color of one race and the cruelty of another. It forces us to view our own culture with a different eye. It features redemption, nay, salvation. The camera captures the prairie beautifully, the bluest of blue skies and the whitest and puffiest of white clouds, the most colorful of colorful ground, the roundest of rolling hills, and the largest of buffalo herds. This movie was a risky project. The story and the symbolism is simple, but it was filmed and performed masterfully. It deserved the seven Academy Awards it received and then some. A must-see masterpiece. Ten out of ten does no justice. See for yourself.",

                "This is an amazing film--particularly from an artistic point of view as well as the film's ability to convey emotion. When I saw this film in the theater, I felt totally drained and very sad, so it's obvious that Kevin Costner did a great job in directing this film. It was just wonderful.Now this isn't to say that the film is perfect. While great, in many ways the film makes the same mistake old-time Westerns used to make--they present characters in simple and black/white terms. In the old days, Indians were seen as savage, stupid and brutal--and for the most part, that's exactly how the Whites are portrayed in the film. Plus, the Sioux are practically perfect in every way. It's nice to see the deficiencies of older films are being counter-balanced--but it isn't very accurate either. In fact, twenty years earlier, I think LITTLE BIG MAN did a better job in showing the natives in a more realistic manner. The characters weren't quite as one-dimensional in this earlier film.Now despite this handicap, DANCES WITH WOLVES is still a marvelous film and deserved Oscar recognition--and not for reasons of political correctness. A combination of great evocative music, breathtaking cinematography and excellent acting made this one of the great films of the 1990s. However, from a purely historical point of view, it isn't the best history lesson--though it is a darn bit closer to the truth than you'd see in most other films of the genre.",

The main ingredients of the story between these two movies is fairly similar - however, the pace and finesse with which Dances with Wolves portrays the development of the relationship between John and the Indians is masterfully done. While Avatar has huge flaws in its story-telling including some scenes with very weak dialogue - it might have gotten away with it as the audience is perhaps distracted by the bombardment of impressive CGI effects!If you thought Avatar was good and haven't seen Dances with Wolves in a while - I highly recommend it.

                "\"Dances with Wolves\" is hated by quite a lot of people. Is it perhaps because the Indians aren't depicted as the bad guys for once or is it because this isn't the usual Western in which you'll not find a justification for the slaughtering of the Indians? Is it because it is very long or is it because Kevin Costner is in it? I don't know, but I do know it is very cool to dislike everything he has done, but I'm not following the masses. I can still think for myself and I must say that, even though the man has done some bad projects (for instance \"Waterworld\"), this movie is absolutely one of his best.The movie starts with showing us a wounded Lieutenant John Dunbarr (Kevin Costner) who is about to have his leg amputated. Because he wants to keep it, he decides to flee and go back to his troops. Than he does something stupid. He takes a horse and starts running in front of the rebel front line, but doesn't get hit once. His troops, overwhelmed by so much 'bravery' all jump up and start fighting again and eventually win the battle. Because a general has seen what happened, Dunbarr gets the honor of having his wounds being treated by the general's surgeon, who saves his leg. Now that he feels better again, he asks to be send to a remote outpost in the West. Arriving there, he finds himself in the middle of the wilderness, all alone and surrounded by hostile Sioux. His only companion is his horse and an old wolf that he calls Two-socks. Gradually he gets accepted by the tribe, where he is known as \"Dances with Wolves\" and falls in love with \"Stands With a Fist\", a white woman who had been adopted as a young girl and was raised by the tribe. But while he is living with the Indians, the West is very fast being conquered and one day he finds new troops in his camp and even though he is an American soldier, he is seen as a traitor.I've always had a weak spot for the not-so-average Western, so when this movie first came out I was already a fan. Now, so many years after it was first shown, this is still one of the best Westerns ever. I like the fact that it shows the Indians not as savages, but as normal, loving people who only defended what was rightfully theirs. I like the fact that the movie isn't sugar sweet, but shows every detail very realistically. I even like the fact that the soldiers are seen as the bad guys for once. Add to this some very good acting and directing and an interesting story and you know you've got something special. This is a very good movie that should be seen by everybody. I give it an 8/10.",

                "\"Avatar\" vs \"Dances With Wolves\". Round One. Fight! 1. Sam Worthington and Kevin Costner both play soldiers. Worthington comes across as a brain dead jar-head, whilst Costner's character is a bit more complex, at once naive, disillusioned, smart and funny. One point to Costner.2. Both films utilise extensive voice over narration. Costner's is better written. One more point to Costner.3. Cameron was an experienced director when he made \"Avatar\" and should have known better. Costner, in contrast, was young, inexperienced and on debut. One point to Costner for being a directorial virgin.4. \"Avatar\" was a zillion dollar enterprise. Costner partially financed this movie himself and based it on a script by a broke guy who slept in his house. One point to Costner's film for having a low carbon footprint.5. Both films have heroes who abandon a technologically superior race and \"go native\" by joining an alien tribe. In \"Wolves\", the tribe is slow to embrace the white hero. In \"Avatar\", Cameron cheats by making his hero \"prophecised by the planet\"; they have to embrace him. One point to Costner for not trying to rip off George Lucas' \"Force\".6. \"Avatar\" looks like a video game. One point to \"Wolves\" for not looking like \"Avatar\"7. \"Wolves\", though stupid, is filled with nuance, subtle details and quiet moments. \"Avatar\" bashes our heads with everything. One point to Costner for not damaging our heads.8. \"Avatar\" has horses with six legs whilst \"Wolves\" has horses with 4 legs. One point to Costner for not making stupid crap up.9. Costner's film emphasises the communication barriers between the natives and the hero, albeit clunkily. In \"Avatar\", communication issues are quickly brushed aside. One point to \"Wolves\".10. Cameron's film doesn't show much of the customs or daily activities of the natives. One point to Costner.11. Costner is embraced by the tribe after taming a wolf, rescuing a woman and hunting buffalo. Worthington is embraced by the tribe after riding a dragon. Dragon's are stupid. One more point to Costner.12. Colonialists are portrayed as one-dimensional villains in both films. In Costner's film, however, these villains only appear during a brief climax. One point to Costner for serving less crap.13. Both films portray the natives in a romantic, \"noble savage\" fashion. In \"Wolves\", however, the tribe is shown at war with rival tribes and massacres a white homestead. This does not quite counteract the sentimental portrayal of the natives throughout the rest of Costner's picture, but on the flip side, \"Wolves\" has the arduous task of revising 80 years of racist cinematic portrayals of Native Americans. \"Avatar\", in comparison is...well it's just stupid. One more point to Costner.14. The natives in \"Wolves\" belong to the Sioux tribe. The natives in \"Avatar\" are at once Native Indians, Rastafarians, Africans, hippies, Smurfs, cats, aliens, Disney creatures and Egyptians. One point to Costner for offending less races.15. The characters in Costner's film have cool symbolic names like \"Stands with Fist\". In \"Avatar\", we have symbolic names like Navi (naive), Selfridge (selfish), Grace Augustine (possesses grace like St Augustine?), Pandora (trouble when opened) and Sully (he's tainted). One point to Costner for not being Cameron.16. Cameron's film has unimaginative action scenes. \"Wolves\" has no real action scenes. It's more of a tone poem, and aesthetically thwarts genre expectations. One more point to Costner.17. The first five decades of cinema portrayed native American Indians in an incredibly racist fashion. \"Broken Arrow\" was the first film to rectify this, before revisionist westerns began to appear in the 1970s, with masterpieces like Altman's \"Buffalo Bill\", \"Ulzana's Raid\", \"Hombre\" and marginally interesting films like \"A Man Called Horse\", \"Soldier Blue\" and \"Cheyenne Autumn\". When \"Wolves\" was released, films about Native Americans became increasingly melancholic, mourning the loss of a race which history had now accepted as being \"ethnically cleansed\". Is Costner's film more melancholic than \"Avatar\"? Yes. One point to Costner.18. Both films have been praised for their cinematography. Costner's compositions are simple and lack any significant depth, purpose or weight, but he should be commended for the poetic and ethereal style of the film. It's Malick-lite, but it's brave. \"Avatar\" looks like fluorescent vomit. One point to Costner.19. Bizarrely, both films have the white hero having sex with a native girl, as though this transfer of bodily fluids unifies races and symbolically brings rival cultures together. Insultingly, the native is deemed inhuman unless accepted as a white man's object of desire. Half a point to Costner.20. When \"Wolves\" was released it was fresh and relatively original. \"Avatar\" is one clich\u00e9 after the next. One point to Costner for not being an unimaginative plagiarist.21. \"Avatar\" was bashed for the \"white saviour\" clich\u00e9. This clich\u00e9, or fantasy, involves white heroes \"saving\" a \"victimized tribe\" by becoming a top dog within the tribe, the white man always retaining his dominant position. In \"Wolves\", Costner remains inept throughout, is rescued by the natives and ABANDONS the natives when the white man attacks. In the \"director's cut\" we even become aware that he never understands Sioux traditions and will never be able to assimilate. One point to \"Wolves\" for being intellectually defensible.22. \"Avatar\" ends with the white man attacking the natives. \"Wolves\" has no crowd pleasing action scenes and instead hints at the slaughter of the natives with a simple shot of a Spanish helmet. One point to Costner for poetry.8/10 \u2013 \"Wolves\" wins. The 4 hour cut in particular is a great film which avoids the sentimental pro-Sioux feel of the 3 hour cut.

                "`Dances With Wolves'When I first saw the movie Dances With Wolves several years ago the story affected me in a heavy way, so much so that I decided that it would be a long time before I watched it again.  The story is not entertainment.  It is a lesson.  Last week I watched the movie again with a new understanding. Many of the published reviews seem to dislike the movie for various reasons. They are the ones that missed the point of the story.The story is, of course, fiction based on a novel by Michael Blake. Fortunately, Michael Blake also wrote the screenplay for the movie insuring fidelity with his vision.  To the credit of Kevin Costner, who was one of the producers and the director, he allowed the story to be what Michael Blake had originally created.  Costner showed great sensitivity in not only capturing the personalities of all the major characters, but making the land itself (in this case South Dakota) one of the major players.\nThe land was not just a backdrop or playing field.  It was the main character and very much alive.  The cinematography was some of the best I've ever seen and in the tradition of the great movie director, John Ford. Ford had an ability to present the land in all its beauty, which also just happened to have a story occurring on it.In Dances With Wolves, the land of South Dakota might initially appear to be a bleak place, but as Lieutenant Dunbar (Costner) spends more time at his isolated fort, he somehow slowly merges his soul with the surrounding territory.  The life on the land eventually stumbles onto his location, including a wolf and a tribe of Sioux.  The Sioux and Dunbar mistrust each other initially but through curiosity learn how to communicate with each other, however painfully slow. The wolf too was curious about the soldier, but kept his distance for a while.  Finally, the wolf trusts Dunbar enough to play with him on the prairie.  The Sioux see them playing.  Here was a white man not killing the animals.  He had earned a new name: Dances-With-Wolves.The main difference between this movie and a John Ford movie was the way Costner humanized the Sioux characters.  In a John Ford movie, most Indians were the enemy.  The only 'good' Indians were the cavalry scouts, but we never really met these scouts as people.  John Ford hired Navaho people to play the parts of Indians in his cavalry trilogy, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande, which were filmed in Monument Valley on the Navaho Reservation. Years later, Ford attempted to humanize the Native Americans in a movie called Cheyenne Autumn, but by then Ford was an old man and had lost most of his creative genius.  It is a hard movie for me to watch.Costner's movie takes great pains to allow us to know the Sioux characters. The story is about them as seen through the eyes of a perceptive white man, who had been given a new life by the gods when his attempt at suicide ended with his recognition as a war hero.What I see when I watch the movie: I see ten thousand years of evolution and experience of a human tribe on the North American continent with the most recent characters at the leading edge of the current (1860) time. The character's lives are so well presented that I sense the history of their past  In other words, I understand why they do what they do.  What depresses me about the movie is that I know the ending but the characters don't.  I know that their natural way of life is coming to an end.  The characters don't know.  To me, the movie is a story of the 4 billion, six hundred million years of natural evolution which is about to meet technology. Technology will be as devastating to this tribe and the land as if an asteroid had hit the earth.The beauty of the Sioux life is so precisely shown in this movie.  Their everyday routine of just living off the land is seen the same way as a buffalo eating the grass.  The Sioux adapted to the land the way it was. You see the grass move in waves like the ocean does when the invisible winds touch the surfaces.   You see the effects of the same winds that blow across the face and hair of Stands-With-a-Fist.  You hear the same winds.  The same winds take the smoke from the lodges away from the village. The land and air and life merge in a poetic movement.The horses seem more natural and free in their herd next to the village. They are part of the tribe.  You can see the magnificence of the Sioux riders as they become one with the horse as they hunt the buffalo.  I suppose, in a way, the horse was a step in technology for the Sioux since they didn't have the horse until the Spanish Conquistadors brought them. But when they adapted their life to the horse, they became a great people. I look at it as a step in evolution, not a step in technology.We find that the holy man, Kicking-Bird, played by Graham Green, was a hen-pecked husband, something we can all identify with no matter what race or ethnic group.  His wife saw more than he did, especially the budding love between Lieutenant Dunbar and Stands-With-a-Fist, who was played by the heavy-duty stage actress Mary McDonnell.  She is important to our story because we understand the Sioux from her translations.  As an actress, she was so convincing in her struggle to remember long forgotten English words from her childhood, from the time before she came to live with the Sioux. Kicking-Bird on the other hand represented the soul of the Sioux People. He was patient and was the type of person you would want as a friend.We have Rodney Grant playing the part of Wind-in-His-Hair, the warrior who was quick to anger but was smart enough to listen to his elders and not kill the white soldier.  Rodney Grant represented the beauty and pride of the Sioux People.  He speaks the last relevant words in the story by proclaiming that he is the friend of Dances-With-Wolves.  Before Dunbar became Dances-With-Wolves, Wind-in-His-Hair would have been happy to kill him.`Red Crow' Westerman played the part of the chief, Ten-Bears.  We've seen him play the part of a shaman in other movies.  He represented the wisdom and of the Sioux People and was also their prophet.What movie about Native Americans could be told without Wes Studi?  In this movie he plays the enemy Pawnee so convincingly that you really hate him. Not only is he the enemy to the white man but the Sioux also.  Wes Studi can be very intense in his savagery, but in the eyes of the Pawnee, he was only protecting his tribal interests.So we see the Sioux and, to a lessor degree, the Pawnee in their soon-to-end natural states.  We immediately feel at home with the Sioux.  The Pawnee aren't quite as lovable, especially when we see Wes Studi scalping the muleskinner.  The first disturbing scene is when the Pawnee attack the Sioux village and we see that to save themselves, the Sioux need the technology (the rifles) of the white soldier.  The Pawnee were so fierce looking (again convincingly by Wes Studi) that we fear for the Sioux tribe but see that the rifles are out of place in this natural world.  It is another technological step in the same magnitude as the horse.  But for all their beauty and greatness, we know they cannot win the final battles with the white civilization because they are so grossly outnumbered.\nThere is the core of the problem.  The over-population of the modern civilization overruns their own land so they come to the land of the Sioux and destroy without asking.  You could see it in the face of every tribal member as they walked past dead and skinned buffalo which were left to rot in the sun after the buffalo hunters had skinned them for their hides. They were absolutely stunned and sick at the sight.  Whoever did this had no soul.  I extend the message of this movie to today and see population running amuck, stripping the land of resources and changing the atmosphere. It is too painful to contemplate.To emphasize the loss and waste of the beautiful prairie life, near the end of the movie we see the soldiers shooting at the wolf for fun.  The wolf is confused and doesn't understand that bullets are hitting near him. Eventually a bullet strikes the wolf and we hear him cry out.  For me that was the most painful scene of all because I know that's what people do.  I see people kill a beast for the trophy.  They take it home and hang it on the wall.  The soul of that animal has been cast aside by a human, which has no soul.The beauty is not in the trophy.  The beauty is in the life.  The ending for the wolf represents the ending for the Sioux and all the other tribes that lost the natural way of life.  Therefore I am just as disturbed for the Sioux as I am about the wolf.  I am disturbed for the future of the Earth.",

Dances With Wolves is one of them. For me to have the patience to watch a film more than a couple of times then the film needs to make me want to watch it over and over. Let me tell you I have seen this film more than a few times. I think you know when a film is special to you when you watch it and you keep thinking to yourself \"oh this scene coming up is great\", if you can say that continually whilst watching a film then you know you are watching a great film.As for the film itself, cinematography has never been bettered, Costners acting is OK but it his presence rather than his acting that has brought gravitas to his movies, you certainly cant argue with his directing, which along with Orson Wells, Tarantino and a few select others must rank alongside as one of the best directorial debuts. The supporting cast is excellent especially Graeme Greene who is the wonderful Kicking Bird and of course Rodney A Grant.I shamefully dont know too much about the history of the Indian population in America, so I dont know whether the events or portrayals in the film are accurate, however artistic license is surely allowed when making what is first and foremost a piece of entertainment. Being British I have seen many an American film with British stereotypes, not once have I been offended or appalled, as I see them as interpretations, God knows British filmmakers are just as guilty of such generalisations when it comes to \"foreign\" characters.Marvel at the wonderful film-making in this film not political inaccuracies after all this is a story, and a damn fine one at that, remember King Kong didnt really climb up the Empire State Building and you dont here gorillas complaining about being misrepresented.

If there is an afterlife for films, this would go straight to the pearly gates. Kevin Costner and his creative team are saints of modern film-making. Against all odds, they created a challenging, beautiful movie about a dark period in American history. And the movie, with its statements apparent, never shifts left or right, for which we are all truly thankful. It is a story, plain and simple. They would never make a movie this slow today. They'd never make a movie with this kind of character and story development today, either. The only thing that comes any where near close is the \"Lord of the Rings\" films. This is the best period movie, history movie, and Western all rolled into one. Make no mistake about it, the best film of the nineties is not just a flick, it will restore your faith in films for a long time. Unfortunately, after seeing \"Waterworld\", it won't restore your faith in Kevin Costner. It would take another \"Dances With Wolves\" to do that, and since \"Dances With Wolves\" is a perfect film, that would be impossible. 10/10",

                "Dances with Wolves is a great movie, make no mistake about that, Kevin  Costner had lighting in a bottle. Costner has not come close to movie  success since wolves. The cast is excellent, Kicking Bird, Stands with  Fist, Wind in his Hair and my quiet favorite smiles a lot, smiles a Lot  had trouble with growing up and becoming a brave, until it is forced  on him, his mood after he has killed the first time is priceless.  Some people say Dances with Wolves was an anti white movie, that is  total bull, it tells the true story the way few movies have of the  cruelty of the white people. People don't want to admit this movie is a  true telling of the way white people treat other races and nature. It  is a hard movie to digest.It is a hard movie to admit the truth. The  other thought is a lot of movie fans want car chases and explosions. If  a movie is thoughtful, it is labeled boring. Dances is one of the top  15 movies of all time. 9 out of 10 stars.  Dances with wolves I am wind in his hair Do you see that I am your  friend? Can you see that you will always be my friend?",

                "The best Western I've ever seen. One of its greatest strengths is its even handed portrayal of both sides of what was a gruesome bigotry ridden fight for land, opportunity, and way of life, between two very different cultures in the late 1800's. The Civil Wars' leftovers were a maliciously violent and frighteningly ignorant bunch, pit them against a culture of genuinely primitive & savage people (scalping & yelping pridefully about it \u2013 wow) and you have a perfect breeding ground for intolerance, impetuous violence, and never ending retaliatory fighting. \"Dances with Wolves\" provides a context for understanding both sides' humanity (for better and for worse) concerning this scar on our nation's history. Said understanding is permitted through an engaging story told on a stunning backdrop of our disappearing plains and enriched with beautifully moving music. In 2007, \"Dances with Wolves\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It may drive home the meaning of being human more than any other film I've ever seen. It won 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture 1990; I'm not at all surprised and support the Library of Congress' decision.",

                "I have always been fascinated about Native Americans especially their customs and believes. I didn't like some of the films that portrayed them all as savages because like any society, there are good and bad people in them.Finally with Dances with Wolves, we have a balanced story where we are shown that the Indians are not savages, they are just trying to live on their land, the white men are the invaders but that was never shown before. This film shows what the Indians were like before the white men flooded their land, ordering them off it and moving them where they could keep an eye on them. The Indians see Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner)and wonder what this means, as he is the first white man they have seen in a while and know that his arrival will have consequences for their people and we know that it did for them and the film comments on this, at the end. I have to say, watching this movie and thinking what happened in real life, I felt anger on their behalf. What right did these white people have for invading their land, arrogantly deciding they knew what was best for these proud people and dictating to them about the beliefs they should have, the clothes they should wear and how they should behave. It was a terrible injustice and it was about time someone showed the other side to the Indians.The film is just so beautiful. The locations are stunning, the music fits with the action, the characters you couldn't help warming to, accept those nasty army men who I was glad was killed as if anyone deserved to die, it was them and makes a change because in the 50's and onwards, the audience would be cheering them on and not the Indians but the positions are reversed in this film and we are cheering the Indians on. The film is funny in parts but still manages to convey a serious message about the mistreatment of the Native Americans in the past. There are some amazing scenes. One at the start of the movie where Dunbar overhears doctors saying they will have to cut his foot off and he escapes and later decides he doesn't want to live without his foot so rides into enemy fire to be killed and at one stage let's go off the reins and raises his hands as if to say he is ready to die. Another incredible scene was when the Indians were hunting buffalo, the sequence was so huge, the action seemed to take over the scene on what seemed a never ending canvas.People have moaned about the length of the film but I think it is just right. Every scene Costner has added to the film is justified and the movie is never boring, it keeps the audience focused on the screen.I loved the romance between Dunbar and Stands with a fist (Mary McDonnell). The chemistry between them sizzles and yet there is such tenderness.I also like Dunbar's relationships with Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), Wind in his hair (Rodney A. Grant) and Ten Bears (Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman.' This is a very emotional film that had me in tears at times especially when Cisco the horse and Two Socks the wolf are killed. I got so caught up in the film that I was screaming at the screen and that is the power of the film where it sucks you so completely into the story. Cisco and Two Socks are just as much characters as the humans in the film and you have watched them throughout the film and are devastated when they are killed in the way they are. I laughed my head off when Cisko kept escaping the Indians and going back to Dunbar. And Two Socks who learns to trust Dunbar by the end and even takes food from his hand.I think what is also so unique about the movie is that the characters speak Lakota and it is so interesting listening to a different language other then English all the time.Well done, Kevin and the rest of the cast and crew for making such a moving film.",

The western had long been forgotten in the movie kingdom.  Kevin Costner single handedly brought it back---and brought it to life with flare, style, perfection, and beauty.  He won Best Director in his first attempt at directing.  That says it all.  His vision into the past is like opening a book and reading the tale just as it was transcribed from one human to another.  Imagine how Kevin must've felt riding horses amidst real buffalo, real Native American Indians, upon the open plains just as it was done 100 years ago.  Put yourself in his boots.  I guarantee you'd feel the exact same way he felt while making it, and the exact way I feel every time I watch it.  There are none better, and nothing else can compare to Dances With Wolves.

I am not a Kevin Costner basher, he has done some work I don't care for, but this and a few others(Field of Dreams for instance) actually does show he has talent. He does do a heartfelt job directing, and his acting isn't too shabby either, in fact he gives a certain decency to Dunbar which I had difficulty not empathising with. He is very well supported by Graheme Greene and Mary McDonell who is especially brilliant. The cinematography and scenery are just magnificent, while John Barry's score is nothing short of amazing. The moving climax gives further emotional weight to an already poignant story, while the script is wholly credible and the characters feel real.

                "Like most of the commentators here, I found \"Dances With Wolves\" to be a moving and superbly made movie. Others have eloquently talked about the wonderful music and score, the very real script, and excellent acting, so there is no need for me to elaborate. But another element of the movie that I found even more notable is its depiction of Native Americans as individuals with feelings, honorable if at the same time frequently peculiar customs, and as human beings with human urges and impulses. What a refreshing contrast to all of the pablum and nonsense that has been the staple of Hollywood and its treatment of \"injuns\" over the years.So it comes as no surprise that some of the criticisms here come from people who believe the movie is anti-white or anti-army or glorifies Native Americans. But I believe these comments completely miss the mark. First off, Costner in the movie himself portrays an army figure--the movie is trying to show that not all people in the army are beasts. This is again brought out by the young leader of the troops attempting to arrest Costner and bring him back to trial; this soldier is depicted as a fair and honest young man put in a difficult spot.Perhaps one of the reasons for the shortsightedness of some of the movie critics is their lack of understanding of the terrible plight faced by native Americans and the awful, holocaust-like consequences of the policy that was known as \"Indian Removal.\" And yes, I am a professor who knows something about the subject and who uses this film in class (and I am not afraid to admit it). Please have a look at \"As Long as Grass Grows or Water Runs\" a chapter in Howard Zinn's famous book, \"A People's History of the United States.\" It uses many primary sources to describe exactly what happened; the phrase, by the way, was a promise made by Andrew Jackson (later President Jackson) to Cherokee Indians if they would relocate (a promise later broken, of course). Jackson, by the way, refused to enforce a court order from the Supreme Court in the case of Worcester v. Georgia involving an individual sentenced to prison for questioning the legitimacy of laws repressing the Cherokees. Jackson also fought the Creeks killing hundreds of them and later boasted, \"the truth is, the (Creeks) did not respect the power of the United States...We bleed our enemies in such cases to give them their senses.\" From 1814 to 1824, Jackson was instrumental in fashioning a series of treaties that deprived Indians of over 3/4 of Alabama and Florida, one-third of Tennessee, one-fifth of Georgia and Mississippi, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. These treaties were little more than land grabs and Jackson is widely known to have practiced extensive bribery and other dirty tricks in securing them. At the same time, Jackson and his friends and relatives received many patronage appointments as land agents, traders etc (I guess he would have gotten along well with Dick Chenney and Bush) and of course, he and his friends bought up much of this land that became suddenly available.Another good source for what happened to the Indians is the eyewitness account of a soldier who served in the mounted infantry. John G. Burnett in 1890 published his reminiscences, \"The Cherokee Removal through the Eyes of a Private Soldier\". \"I was sent as interpreter into the Smoky Mountain Country in May, 1838, and witnessed the execution of the most brutal order in the History of American Warfare. I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes, and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning, I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into 645 wagons and started toward the West.\" This evokes images not unlike those showing S.S. officers putting Jews in railroad cars. \"At this time, 1890,\" continues Burnett, \"we are too near the removal of the Cherokees for our young people to fully understand the enormity of the crime that was committed against a helpless race. Truth is, the facts are being concealed from the young people of today.\" Burnett later describes the \"streams of blood that flowed in the Indian country in the summer of 1838\" and the \"4000 silent graves that mark the trail of the Cherokees to their exile\", again very much like a World War II death march. So what I find shocking about \"Dances With Wolves\" is that it shows, to a great extent, the brutality of the conflict between \"settlers\" from one civilization, and the people who already lived on the land. This stands as a testament to Costner and his willingness to take this brave position. It is precisely because this subject has become taboo and because most Americans haven't a clue as to their own history, because their image of America is similar to Pleasantville (before colorization), that many people find this movie revolting and unacceptable. Hence, they prefer to shoot the messenger of the \"bad\" news-- Costner.Finally, as others have pointed out, the movie does not glorify all Native Americans. It shows that there is a spectrum of behavior amongst them, and also shows that many of their customs (eating fresh meat from just-killed animals, for example) are shocking and barbaric to us today.",

Eventually he finds out her true identity from a newspaper article about her escape. He offers to help her get to her destination in exchange for exclusive rights to her story, and secures her cooperation by threatening to turn her in to her father if she does not agree.\nAndrews and Warne share hotel rooms on their trip, pretending to be husband and wife to keep from arousing suspicion. Because she is a married woman, they put up a blanket as a barrier, with Warne referring to it as the walls of Jericho. One of the other bus passengers recognizes Andrews from an article offering a $10,000 reward for her return. While the bus is stranded in mud, the passenger offers to split the money with Warne if he helps him turn in Andrews. Warne scares the passenger away by implying that hes a professional criminal looking for $1,000,000 in ransom money and then threatens to shoot him when he becomes frightened. Warne and Andrews then leave the bus to hitchhike in case the other passenger decides to turn them in to the police.\nAfter they spend the night sleeping in hay, Andrews gets a driver to stop by flashing one of her legs, who turns out to be a robber who drives off with their possessions. After chasing after him, Warne inexplicably returns with a bloody temple and the mans car. In the meantime, the father reluctantly agrees to allow the marriage to the aviator if his daughter returns. While spending another night in a blanket-partitioned hotel room, Andrews throws herself at Warne and proposes that they both be together. Warne seemingly rejects her and after she falls asleep he drives back to New York in the middle of the night. He sells his story about his love and potential marriage to Andrews to his old boss for $1000, so as not to propose to her while broke. Meanwhile, the suspicious manager of the hotel kicks out Andrews when she finds out that Warne has left.\nThinking that Warne hates her, Andrews phones her father in order to turn herself in. Her father picks her up with a police escort while Warne is returning just in time to see them drive by. Angry with her, Warne contacts the father about reward money. He agrees to go to their home while a real marriage ceremony for Andrews and the aviator is to take place. He only comes to collect $39.60 for his expenses and not the full $10,000 and admits to the father that he loves his daughter. The father starts to like Warne and during the ceremony manages to convince his daughter that Warne really loves her and that she should leave the aviator. Andrews runs away during the ceremony, her father pays off the aviator to annul the wedding, and she eventually marries the reporter.

                "In his autobiography, The Name's Above the Title, Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters, the hero, the heroine, the comedian, and the villain.What Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films, the characters of hero and comedian are combined. Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself, especially with that system all her own. But in doing what he did for Clark Gable's character, Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy, the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the mold.Capra's autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie. Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio, along the lines of Republic or Monogram. As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it. Capra also had a stroke of good luck. Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B. Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM. In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day, drunk as a skunk, is priceless. Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn't have been more cooperative.At some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something. He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day. So the publicity drums were beat.The rest as they say is history. It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios. And it set the standard for screwball comedy.The film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert. They're together for most of the film so if it doesn't click between the two of them, you have people walking out in droves. Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount, ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond. Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM. It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent, a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in. Gable and Colbert did only one other film together, Boom Town for MGM. You can't get much more different than those two films. Boom Town had a huge MGM budget, Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well, and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein. It's also a great film, but it's not a classic like It Happened One Night.",

Gable and Colbert each get roles that are nicely suited to them, and are well-remembered for their performances.  The supporting cast also rounds out the picture with some good character acting.The cross-country trip on the bus and via other assorted methods is fun to watch, with several nice vignettes that complement the main story line. (The atmosphere on the long bus trip is done especially well.)  The plot is of course not meant to be taken too seriously in itself, but it comes in very handy for setting up good characters and comedy.It all comes across as effortlessly entertaining romantic comedy, with some classic scenes and characters you learn to care for in spite of their mistakes.",

                "Consider this, \"It Happened One Night\" was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70+ years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runner-ups for oldest film are 1930's screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant. The main reason \"It Happened One Night\" worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable, who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra's direction. Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production. Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut. Cohn told Capra: \"That French broad likes money\" and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $50,000 (double her usual price) and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days. Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film.The film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra, a great script that would play well with small town America, and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress (Colbert) trying to escape the control of her father (nicely played by Walter Connelly). Dodging her father's private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter (Gable) who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other (brainless brat and obnoxious bully) as an undisclosed affection develops. On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other.While the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film. As another reviewer has written: \"Far from lovey-dovey, the dialogue is witty, sharp and occasionally heartless. We may know the outcome, but the road to get there is paved with arguments, anger and misunderstandings. It's also clever, funny and a bit risqu\u00e9 (for 1934)\" . During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult, motivated by a desire to improve her companion's opinion of her. Gable shows real star presence, playing a confident, charming, and resourceful gentleman.

                "IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934), directed by Frank Capra, based on a short story \"Night Bus\" by Samuel Hopkins Adams, ranks one of the best known and popular romantic comedies from the 1930s, thanks to the star chemistry of Clark Gable (on loan from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) and Claudette Colbert (on loan from Paramount), with fine direction by Frank Capra, witty screenplay by Robert Risken, and for being the very first motion picture to win all five major Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Gable); Best Actress (Colbert); Best Director (Capra); Best Screenplay and Best Picture. This might have been an \"upset\" in 1934, considering other top-rated films and performances of the year, but who would have imagined IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT to still be as entertaining today as it was back in 1934?This now well-known plot that's been remade twice by Columbia as EVE KNEW HER APPLES (1945) with Ann Miller and William Wright; and YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT (1956) with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon, opens in a yacht in Miami where Ellen \"Ellie\" Andrews (Claudette Colbert), spoiled daughter of a millionaire Wall Street banker, Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly), who disapproves of her recent marriage to aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas), making arrangements on having it annulled. Following a heated argument with her father, Ellie runs from her state room, jumps overboard and swims to shore. Eluding her father's hired detectives, Ellie, acquiring new clothes, purchases a night bus ticket bound for New York City where she plans to meet Westley. While on board, Ellen encounters Peter Warne (Clark Gable), a hot-headed reporter recently fired by his editor, Joe Gordon (Charles C. Wilson). With both disliking each other immensely, Warne, having discovered the \"spoiled brat's\" identity, becomes her constant traveling companion in order to get an exclusive story and his job back. Hours before reaching New York and taking a rest stop in an auto camp, misunderstandings occur as Ellen awakens to find both Peter and the car gone.A simple story playing like an overlong \"B\" movie, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a memorable bus trip of so many classic scenes that have been imitated by others but never duplicated. Highlights include the \"Walls of Jericho\" where Peter and Ellen share a room in auto camps where a blanket is tossed over a rope that separates the couple as they sleep for the night; Peter demonstrating to Ellen on how a man undresses, particularly one in which he removes his shirt to no undershirt underneath; Peter's correct method of dunking a dough-nut into a cup of coffee; and the classic hitchhiking scene where Peter fails to attract cars while Ellen comes up with a method all her own.Although IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is essentially a Claudette Colbert movie from start to finish (there's no secondary female character, quite rare for its time). Due to the strength of Gable's performance, this has been hailed to be his best comedic role. Gable's character is hot-headed and forceful, living by a moral code. Although he shares a cabin with a married woman, that's all he does. He even tells Colbert's Ellie when she asks if she'll ever see him again, he replies, \"I make it a policy not to run around with married women.\" And when he's hungry, he takes a carrot from a farm rather than going through the method of panhandling. This is Gable, a role model. Director Frank Capra, whose subject matter is usually on people, captures the many extras, especially those on the bus and auto camps, to make them appear as important as leading players. Roscoe Karns is equally memorable, \"believe you me!\" as the gabby bus passenger, Oscar Shapeley from Orange, New Jersey; Ward Bond as the tough talking bus driver; the meek Arthur Hoyt and the nosy/ domineering Blanche Frederici as the auto camp owners; Georgie Breakston the poor boy traveling on the bus with his mother (Claire McDowell); along with other passengers gathered together and singing \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze,\" to a player of a snoring fat and bald man who rests his head on Colbert's shoulder. During it's entire 106 minutes, there's seldom any underscoring. As for the costumes, with the exception of the final 15 minutes, both Gable and Colbert use the same clothing through most of their trip.While Gable and Colbert had challenging roles in their careers, plus their reunion in MGM's large-scale BOOM TOWN (1940), it's amazing how this likable little comedy was the only one to honor them Academy Awards. There's a scene where I feel Gable earned his statuette, the one where he tells Ellen the type of girl he would like to someday marry, saying that those kind of women don't exist anymore. Gable says this with frankness and sincerity. Colbert on the other hand earned hers from that same scene as she she listens and looks on lovingly at Gable with tears flowing down her cheek, coming to realize it happened one night.IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT not only became a perennial favorite on late night television during the 1960s and 70s, but on cable TV as well, ranging from the Disney Channel (1980s), American Movie Classics (prior to 2001) to Turner Classic Movies, and availability on video cassette and finally DVD. While IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT has aged in appearance, it's still timely screen entertainment. There'll never be another film like this again. (***1/2)",

                "In Miami, the spoiled socialite Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is trapped in the yacht of her controller father, the Wall Street banker Andrews (Walter Connolly), who has just annulled her secret marriage with the snobbish aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Out of the blue, Ellie jumps overboard and swims to the shore. Andrews hires a detective agency to find her and offers a 10,000 dollars reward for any information about his daughter. But Ellie pawns her watch, buys some clothing and a bus ticket to New York to meet her lover. She seats side- by-side with the cynical reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable). However, when a thief steals her purse with her money in a bus stop and Ellie does not report to the police, Peter recognizes and blackmails Ellie, asking her to travel together with him. He promises to protect her and in return he would write her adventure to meet King Westley. Along their journey, Ellie falls in love for Peter; but when he vanishes from the motel where they are lodged and contacts her father later, she believes he was only interested in the reward. In the end, love triumphs and the wall of Jericho falls. \"It Happened One Night\" is another delightful and charming romantic comedy of Frank Capra. The romance of a cynical reporter with a spoiled young woman is very funny despite being naive and dated, with witty dialogs, and the chemistry between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is marvelous. The cinematography in black and white is wonderful with magnificent use of lighting to highlight the lead couple.

                "It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic, and on so many `must-see' lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another.  It wasn't until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadn't.The first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony, It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress (Colbert) who marries a shallow, yet dashing aviator.  She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation.  Instead, she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York, where her husband awaits.  The film quickly turns into an `on the road' flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable, a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story.  Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventure.I'm a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy.  Of course, there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone (the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich) but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles.  Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies, with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre, Bringing up Baby, as a five.\nWhatever its classification, It Happened One Night is a charming film that backs up its merit as a multiple Oscar winner.  It is one of those films that may not be completely profound or deep, but is important nonetheless if anything, for its place in film history.--Shelly",

                "Hollywood after all is a town of dumb luck, indeed. I worked there for many years and heard a heck of a lot of stories. This is one of them.Two up and coming actors, and an industrious director willing to roll the dice on an interesting Depression era story, all somehow came together, and went to work at a low budget studio called Columbia Pictures. They put their heads together, put the egos in the back pocket, thank you, applied a little elbow grease and produced one of the most beloved romantic comedies of all time. How's that for a Hollywood happy ending?IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT made Gable a name, whose career was slow to start, and gave a very small studio an undisputed reputation as a can-do organization now open for business. HOORAY! The rest is history, of course, but not without saying what an unforgettable story this is and, perhaps, the very first road trip movie ever produced. Great trivia question.It's also a very simple story; \"young man meets young woman\" and the adventures they share together, going at it as best as they can, and let's not forget during the height of the Great Depression. Truly, audiences at the time needed a good laugh and this gem was their answer, which it remains to this day.Also a tip of the hat to a marvelous supporting cast, foremost Walter Connolly as Colbert's frustrated father, whose bark is worse than his bite. Director Frank Capra outdid himself in this one, FIVE Oscars, a first in 1934.

Ellie runs away from her father sets off across country to get to her husband in New York. On the bus she meets a recently-fired reporter, Peter Warne. The two don't get along but, figuring out who she is, and knowing that her father will have every route into New York covered with private detectives, he offers to help her get to a husband.

Over time they even get to like each other...A gem of a film from legendary director Frank Capra. I was expecting a rather standard romantic drama but It Happened One Night is so much better than that. Warm, and hilariously funny at times, it's certainly not your average romantic comedy. Dialogue is incredibly fresh and snappy and even the romantic side is not straightforward, keeping the schmaltz to a minimum and taking some unpredictable twists and turns.The great direction by Capra and the solid script are aided by wonderful performances from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the lead roles.

                "Capra's 'It Happened One Night' is a fascinatingly shot romantic comedy. It has the 30's feel but at the same time I am surprised that such skill was used in the making of this movie during the 1930s. The camera-work is brilliant as it brings out both the spatial feel and the crowdiness. the long shots are effective and I liked how the scenes change in a sideways 'flip' mode. There's always something about the driving scenes of old classics that amuse me. Clearly the background was shot separately and then projected on to a screen during the shooting of the film while in the foreground the actors are just seated in a car pretending to drive. While the background scene changes, the viewer keeps tuned to the wonderful dialogue between the actors. Needless to add, the film's got fantastic dialogue.Capra also brilliantly gives us a glimpse of the 30's American society, especially focusing on gender and class status. The difference between the upper class rich people and the common ordinary man is shown by their use of language and their non-verbal behaviour. Yet, in a way the film is also ahead of its time. Ellie isn't just some clich\u00e9d damsel of the 30s. She is strong-minded, stubborn and smart (albeit slightly naive). She is one who fights for what she wants rather than giving in easily. Perhaps this is also one quality of hers that attracts Peter but at the same time their funny quarrels also indicate that there is a an equality in gender status (which was something women were struggling with in those days).The characters are very well etched. Peter and Ellie were a lot of fun but I also liked how Alexander Andrews (played excellently by Walter Connolly) was written as the rich father who's got all the money but all he wants for his daughter is her happiness. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together as they match wits and display warm chemistry.'It Happened One Night' has become an instant favourite, one that I definitely plan to revisit.",

                "Frank Capra's idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films. From It Happened One Night to It's a Wonderful Life, Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds. It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression, when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the 1930s into a world where anything can happen, where being a nice person is all you need to succeed. While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored, an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday life.There were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated. Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal. Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity, you smile and wave at them. Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zeke's wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid. Upon seeing Peter and Ellie's car missing, they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there. They cannot afford freeloaders.In another scene, a child's mother has passed out from hunger, because they have no money to buy food. Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds, but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to them.Despite these instances, the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world. In the throes of the stock market crash, this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy. At a time when the country needed release, they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night. Audiences were amused by scenes in the film, such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut. Or, when forced to share a room, Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellie's beds and calls it the `wall of Jericho,' which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellie's marriage. Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence, which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully, finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts. After he gives up, beaten, Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee. The first car that passes stops, as we see extreme close-ups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brake.A master in his profession, Capra left his mark on the films he directed. With an almost childlike cheerfulness, he maintains a sense of dignity and class. The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind, even if its only that a person's ideals could be used to make such a film. Capra's films are still regarded as masterpieces. It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies. It was one of many movies made during the Depression, a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history. It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time.9 out of 10 stars",

                "Released in 1934, Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' ushered in a new era of Hollywood film-making \u0096 the screwball comedy \u0096 and made Academy Award history in the process. It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), a feat that remained unequaled until 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)' and 'The Silence of the Lambs (1991).' As I watch more of his films, Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors, with such classics as 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' ranking among my favourites of all time. This screwball comedy, however, posed a certain problem, since I've never been a huge fan of the sub-genre. Whilst I had enjoyed such films as 'My Man Godfrey' and 'His Girl Friday,' they hadn't really offered anything other than comedy. This means that they did a good job of making us laugh, but never really inspired any other emotions \u0096 which isn't necessarily a handicap, but doesn't appeal to my tastes.Happily, I'm able to announce that 'It Happened One Night' did surpass my expectations, and I found it to be a wonderfully-enjoyable, very touching romantic comedy. The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain, since it reminded me of just about every other 1930s comedy I'd seen, but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best: he put a lot of heart into the film. After building towards a perfect fairytale ending, Capra suddenly snatches it away, slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero. However, the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending, and, when love finally prevails, it feels twice as triumphant. Of course, crucial to the film's success are the two lead performers: Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable, playing characters of completely polar characters. As story runs its course, we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance, and it never feels forced or artificial (despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onset).The plot of the film was based on the story, \"The Night Bus,\" by Samuel Hopkins Adams. Ellie Andrews (Colbert) is the arrogant, spoilt heiress of a wealthy father (Walter Connolly). After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley (Jameson Thomas) against her father's will, Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves, and her desperate father launches a state-wide attempt to retrieve her. It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne (Gable), whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story. Probably one of the best \"road movies\" ever made, 'It Happened One Night' also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature. For example, Ellie's father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon, but is, in fact, shown to be a very kind, reasonable and loving man, who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles (King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss, compensated by a tidy sum of money).Much to my surprise, I'd never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before, but he really was a revelation. Never taking any situation too seriously, and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement, Gable is the laid-back every-man that the audience can relate to, a stark contrast to Colbert's conceited and ungrateful upper-class rich girl. My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road, with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns) threatening to reveal Ellie's true identity. Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands, Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie, threatens to harm Shapeley's family and then chases him into the night. Interestingly, I followed up my viewing of this film with a 1939 Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story, introduced by Cecille B. DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert. This recording can be found, if you're lucky, as a special feature on the 'It Happened One Night' DVD, and it's well worth a listen.",

                "IHON rightly earns it's place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history. A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre, it holds up very well 71 years after it was made.It's a classic tale of the battle of sexes- something that is still so relevant today. We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), who jumps ship from her father's yacht (literally!) in Florida after an argument with said father (played by Walter Connolly) over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley (Jameson Thomas) without her father's consent. Ellie is on a mission- to get to New York to King Westley. But how will she do it? That's how Peter Warne (played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable) comes into the story. Recently fired from his newspaper job, Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York, and, realizing who she is (Her story is all over the news, after all!), offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story- to win him back his job. And so the fun begins. Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances. The trip isn't a smooth one- and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie, which gives us great scenes such as the doughnut-dunking lesson, Walls Of Jericho and the now-classic hitchhiking scene. The humour is still fresh and fast-paced over 70 years later. Oops, I almost forgot the classic 'no undershirt scene' where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses, to reveal (shock horror!) no undershirt, but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of men's undershirts, which dropped dramatically after the film's release (One of the first examples of product placement in film). Great supporting characters, particularly the scene-stealing Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns). Of course it has it's faults- all early talkies do. But any faults are outweighed by the great story. Technically, it was well-made for it's time.IHON won 5 Oscars- Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation. It deserved all of them. Funnily enough, both Colbert and Gable didn\u2019t want any part in the film at first- I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it.

                "It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in 1934 by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office. Yet, after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in 1934. Due to the original small nature of the film, the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio. He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert. Capra's film was a combination of many ideals, emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements. The film unfolds the story in such a attention-grabbing and remarkable way that most of today's cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films. Capra used the idea of a moving camera, one that was not fixed upon a box, but on a moveable crane instead. This produced more sweeping shots, more angles for filming and fewer distance shots. It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie. The film also incorporates back projection of images. This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection. Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage. Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film. The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film. The film was also all talk, the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used. The text cards of silent films were completely discarded. Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gable's character for Claudette Colbert's character by depicting her character in a different light. This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship. Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gable's character seeing her in a `different light.' In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time. Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich (King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter) and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society. The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman, the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era. But the fighting and the banter also show a strong-minded and intelligent woman. The two strong-willed main characters balanced each other out.Capra's techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the 1930s captured film makers and film viewers for over 70 years. Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals. When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capra-esc. Capra's imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere.",

Also: `The Shop Around the Corner' (around the corner from WHERE?), `The Empire Strikes Back' (it doesn't), `The Living Daylights', `True Lies', `Batman Forever', `Species', `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' ... if anyone has any more suggestions, please send them to me.In this case, it happens over several nights, and I'm not sure which particular night is being referred to.  Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isn't COMPLETELY mystifying.  But actually, Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air.  Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end - in most cases it's simply a question of staying awake.  But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all.  I, for one, was convinced that right up until the final moment, it could have gone either way.  How did Capra manage this?  Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated?  I don't suppose it matters: it's results that count.I'm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all.  The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society, it's almost worth creating a sexist society (and then dismantling it), in order to get the art.  In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty' lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists, who, by and large, aren't so easily fooled.  Claudette Colbert isn't feisty.  When she DOES assert her independence, she means it.(And, of course, when Clark Gable asserts his dominance, HE means it.  You don't get sincerity like this these days.)Anyway, the ideology of a film, if there is one, is always beside the point, except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive. This is an attractive film.  Two real individuals, a real story, some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding, constant wit - and, as I expressed amazement at earlier, constant suspense.  And if THAT isn't enough to get you to watch it, note that it was released in 1934.  The Hayes code didn't come into effect until 1935.  Not a moment too late.",

                "It Happened One Night (1934) **** (out of 4) Ellie (Claudette Colbert) is a rich, spoiled brat who runs away from her father (Walter Connolly) after he objects to her runaway marriage. Soon she is out on the road trying to get back to New York when she runs across Peter (Clark Gable), a man who recently quit his job at the newspaper. Peter and Ellie can't stand one another but he agrees to help her reach New York in exchange for an exclusive story.Frank Capra ended up winning Best Director and the picture ending up nabbing all the major awards, which was the first time this had ever been done and it wouldn't happen again until ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST did it fifty years later. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a film that has been copies dozens if not hundreds of times over the years so it's easy to look at it and not see anything original but in 1934 this here was original material and it's easy to see why it was a box office hit and walked away with so many Oscars.It's funny to think that Columbia approached this as a \"B\" movie but it shows what a great director can do with a good story and a wonderful cast. There's no question that Capra's magical touch is all over this film and especially when you see the way it is edited and how it goes for its laughs. There are some hilarious moments scattered throughout the film including the now legendary hitchhiking scene but there's another hilarious and more quiet moment dealing with Gable scaring someone who is trying to work his way in on the reward money.What makes this film so memorable is the fact that you get two superb performances from the two lead legends. Colbert was already a star by the time this came out but she's perfect in the role of the brat who slowly begins to realize that she's been seeing the world in the wrong way. The film also offers up fine support from the likes of Connolly and Roscoe Karns. With that said, it's Gable who steals the picture and it's easy to see why his career never looked back after this. His comic timing is simply flawless throughout and the toughness he brings to this \"charming\" character is something most actors wouldn't have been able to pull off. The chemistry between the two leads certainly make the picture.I do think there are some flaws with the picture including it running five or ten-minutes too long. I think the predictable ending could have happened a little quicker but this is just a minor issue in an otherwise terrific film. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a landmark in Hollywood history and it deserves its reputation.",

                "Sorry to say but this movie is just a bit too overrated. Especially Capra's directing is disappointing, since it's done in such an extremely old fashioned manner for 1934 standards. Surprisingly enough he still won an Oscar for his directing of this movie though.It's definitely an entertaining enough movie to watch. These type of movies were the romantic comedies of the '30's, the sort of Cameron Diaz and Asthon Kutcher flicks of their time, only done with more class and better actors involved. Nevertheless it's just as clich\u00e9d and predictable though. Dozens of these type of movies got made in the '30's and quite frankly I just can't see what it is that makes this movie a better one than any of them.It's a boy meets girl story and of course they can't get along at first but slowly begin to like each other better and more. What makes this movie its story more special is its adventurous elements being thrown in. It's a movie that involves lots of traveling and therefor also many different characters, which mainly gives the movie its adventurous feeling, without ever really getting a big adventure.More fireworks was to be expected, especially from Frank Capra's directing. It's just too formulaic and at times even just plain poor. It's way too old fashioned for 1934 and it's one of those typical movies that features long close-ups for the dramatic moments. It's a very static made film, as if it was just a job that had to be done and no real passion was thrown into it.As could be expected, the acting is still great though, from Clark Gable and the much more unknown Claudette Colbert. They were good together and luckily shared some good chemistry, which made the movie all the more fun to watch. This was actually the movie that earned Clark Gable his only Oscar out of his career. Ironicly enough non of the actors really enjoyed starring in this movie and also lots of well known actor turned the script down and Claudette Colbert, who also received an Oscar for her role in this movie, even didn't took the trouble to attend the award ceremony at first, until hearing upon her win.Yes, I know I'm making the movie sound horrible, which it really isn't. It's basically a movie I enjoyed watching but is no way worthy of this currently high rating on here. There are way better genre movies and Capra movies, with a much lower rating on here though. There are better and more interesting Capra movies to watch out there, which does not mean that this movie is an horrible one though.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

However, I have a reason to finally review \"It Happened One Night\". Tonight, I watched a god-awful mess called \"You Can't Run Away From Love\". Why? Well, because it starred Jack Lemmon and I almost always like his films. Sadly, after a few minutes, I realized it was a musical remake of \"It Happened One Night\". And, sadly, it VERY closely followed the original--and that's the problem. Seeing Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the original is charming and both fine actors were at the top of their game. Jack Lemmon and June Allyson (especially Allyson) were pretty bad--and it's so apparent when they are parroting Gable and Colbert. It made me appreciate the original so much more!

                "This sweet comedy never loses its appeal.  Claudette Colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly, attractive newspaper reporter (Clark Gable). In the beginning, she treats him like a servant, but he never knuckles under to this behavior.  The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous.  It is the classic portrayal of what may be called \"sexual tension.\"  He takes care of her - does not take advantage of her - but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being, she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect.  There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike, and their \"breakfast\" is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find.  As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence, his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny.

                "The cinema was still relatively new to many people in 1934. The silent film era had come and gone, films with sound were now familiar to movie-goers and the Oscars had a few Best Picture winners already named. However, \"It Happened One Night\" probably turned American cinema into a business more than any other film before its time. The production was a commercial blockbuster and dominated the Oscars as it won five Academy Awards (sweeping the picture, director, writing and lead performer categories). \"It Happened One Night\" is a hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy about a young newlywed (Oscar-winner Claudette Colbert) who has been forced onto her rich father's (Walter Connolly) yacht after he annuls the marriage. Colbert has had it with her father and decides to jump ship literally and get back to her new husband (Jameson Thomas). Naturally it is not near as easy as she first expected as nothing seems to go right and she continues to be helped and annoyed by a sleazy tabloid reporter (Oscar-winner Clark Gable) who is just looking for a good story to give to his readers. While at odds with one another, they slowly realize that they have a mutual admiration and love for one another, but will they both realize it before it is too late? Frank Capra (who received his first of three Best Director Oscars here) was arguably the finest director from the 1930s to the early-1960s. His pure style and his deliberate compassion and love for his characters created outstanding film after outstanding film. Still excellent and still a wonderful piece of entertainment, \"It Happened One Night\" is an essential to all lovers of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",

                "The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards, this film is still popular today. That's probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture - Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert - is just great. Those two make this fun to watch. I enjoyed it, however, much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones. It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect. The ending, too, was very weak. Over the last 20 minutes, the two stars go their separate ways (until the very end) and the story gets very stupid.The nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning (for good intentions) but didn't tell Colbert. The latter thought Gable ran out on her. Hollywood, in films of the 1930s and 1940s, loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worst....until the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface. That same theme was in here, along with yet another trivialization of marriage, another common theme during the classic era. Colbert says it herself in one line, mentioning she doesn't care for this other guy, but what the heck, might as well get married, what's the difference? Huh?If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the \"road\" part of this film going longer - with Gable and Colbert trading barbs - it would have been super. Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own. She looks really pixie-ish and cute, although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens, another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars. One of the film world's most famous scenes is in this movie: the hitch-hiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a ride....and gets nowhere while Colbert, on her first try, gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie history.Overall, this is still one of the best comedies of \"The Golden Age,\" even with its faults.",

And then unexpectedly, Valeria, a stunning woman and famous supermodel, will cross paths with Octavio, while in the meantime, her pampered little dog Richie manages to vanish into thin air in the confined space of her apartment. Lastly, Chivo, an ex-guerrilla vagabond, after abandoning his little daughter, unable to make up for lost time, he channels his love to the city&#39;s strays and a mortally wounded Rottweiler.

        "synopsis": "The film opens in the harsh streets of Mexico, where a young man named Octavio and his pal Jorge are speeding down the road. In the backseat of their car lies Octavio's dog, Cofi, a rottweiler who's bleeding all over the seat. Octavio is freaking out, not just because he has to take Cofi to a veterinarian, but he and Jorge are also being chased by some thugs in a yellow truck, shooting at them. Eventually, Octavio loses them, but wrecks his car at an intersection. This wreck sets the stage for the rest of the plot.\nWe then cut back a few days, where we see a punk named Jarocho submitting his dog into the back alley dogfights, held by overweight thug Gerardo, known as \"Fatso\". Jarocho's dog wins the fight, killing the other dog, and Jarocho collects an easy 20,000 pesos. Jarocho is feeling so high and mighty that he decides to let his winning dog loose on some strays, but is stopped when a vagrant named El Chivo pulls out a machete, causing Jarocho and his pals to walk away. Instead, Jarocho sees Octavio's rottweiler, Cofi, wandering the streets, and fully aware of this, he lets his dog loose on it. We then see a rundown home, where Octavio lives with his mother, his brother, Ramiro, and Ramiro's wife, Susana. Octavio is secretly in love with Susana, and despises Ramiro, who beats and cheats on her. Ramiro works as cashier at a local supermarket and is constantly out of money, so he can't pay for diapers or milk for the baby, which frustrates Susana. To earn a little extra cash, Ramiro and his buddy hold-up gas stations, dugstores and groceries. One day, Ramiro says, he will rob a bank, and get all the money he needs.\nJorge eventually shows up at Octavio's, and tells him that Cofi killed Jarocho's dog. Cofi runs up to Octavio, covered in blood, and sits by his master. Suddenly, Jarocho drives up (in the yellow truck) and demands that Octavio give him the money he will lose now that his dog is dead; alternatively, Octavio can lend Cofi to him. Octavio refuses, but Jarocho threatens him and says that Octavio owes him. Octavio just laughs as Jarocho drives away. This gives Octavio an idea. He decides to submit Cofi into the local dogfights, and talks to Fatso. After seeing Cofi win a fight quickly, Fatso agrees to let Octavio participate, and says that Cofi is good for eight fights. Every time there's a fight, Jarocho enters a new dog, and everytime, Cofi kills it. Soon, Octavio is raking in some serious cash. It is now that he asks Susana to go away with him, to the border where they could open a little shop and live together with Susana's baby. Susana politely refuses, saying her love is for Ramiro. However, Susana does confide in Octavio that she is pregnant again, and if Ramiro finds out, he'll be very angry. Octavio promises not to tell. One night, Octavio goes to the drugstore that Ramiro works at, and buys some supplies for the baby. Ramiro gets annoyed, claiming that he can provide for his own child, and threatens Octavio. Octavio tells Ramiro that he's not afraid of him, and headbutts him in the face, making Ramiro's nose bleed. When Ramiro gets home, he beats the crap out of Octavio.\nAfter winning more money from Cofi's fights, Octavio keeps pushing Susana to go away with him. He even tries to make passes at her, but she keeps brushing him away. Finally, however, Susana gives in, and she and Octavio embark on an affair. He asks her what she's going to name her unborn child. She says if it's a girl, then Susana would be nice. Octavio suggests his own name if it's a boy, but Susana does not respond to that. Soon, Ramiro begins to catch on about where Octavio's money comes from, and insists on having half of what Octavio gets, since Cofi is technically Ramiro's dog. Octavio refuses. Ramiro then pulls out a gun, points it at Cofi, and fires. Octavio jumps, but the gun is empty. Ramiro then demands half of the earnings.\nA few days later, Fatso notifies Octavio that Jarocho has a Class-A fighting dog, and that he challenges Octavio to a private fight, with no outside bets, for a cool 40,000. Octavio accepts, but asks Fatso for a favor. The favor, as it turns out, is getting rid of Ramiro, so, after work one night, Ramiro is jumped by Fatso's thugs, taken to the middle of nowhere, and beaten to an inch of his life. This scene plays simultaneously with Octavio and Susana having sex on top of the washing machine. Octavio then asks her to come away with him, that weekend, since he's about to hit a big score. The night before the fight, though, Octavio learns that Ramiro has left, with Susana and the baby. Octavio searches his things, and finds that most of his winnings are gone as well. The next day, he and Jorge scrounge up about 20,000. While Octavio is counting the money, Jorge is watching a talk show, featuing a beautiful young model named Valeria (This comes into play later).\nOctavio and Jorge go the fight, and even though they have just 20,000 instead of the initial 40,000, Jarocho agrees, and the fight begins. Cofi is doing some serious damage to the other dog, when suddenly, Jarocho pulls out a gun and shoots Cofi. Octavio freaks out, and tells Fatso to do something, but Fatso just claims that this is between them. Jorge and Octavio carry Cofi to their car, and put him in the backseat. Octavio tells Jorge to start the car and keep it running, then walks back inside, and stabs Jarocho in the stomach. Octavio then runs back to his car, and speeds away, being pursued by Jarocho's thugs. This is where the wreck occurs.\nThe next story involves the model, Valeria, who was seen earlier. She has just finished the talk show, and is being escorted by a dashing older movie star, who is rumored to be her boyfriend. He leads her to a nicely furnished apartment, with all of her things and a nice view of an advertisement on a billboard with her picture on it. Valeria finds this rather spooky, until her real boyfriend, an older man named Daniel, surprises her. He's bought the apartment for them, with everything he had, and left his wife and two daughters for the much younger Valeria. When she runs to embrace him, part of the floor gives under her heels. Daniel has also brought her dog, a little terrier (I think) named Richie. Their dinner is complete, except for the wine, which Valeria goes to get. She's in her car with Richie, and when she pulls into a certain intersection, she is blindsided by Octavio. Valeria is rushed to a hospital, where Daniel learns from her doctor that Valeria's right leg has almost been completely crushed, but it's salvageable. Richie, however, survived the crash without a scratch on him. Valeria is finally allowed to go home, but she grows bored of being alone while Daniel is at work. One day, while she is playing fetch with Richie, the ball rolls into the hole in the floor, and Richie climbs in to find it. Valeria calls him back, but he doesn't come. When Daniel comes home five hours later, Richie still hasn't come back, and Valeria is growing worried. In the middle of the night, Valeria can hear\nRichie scratching and whimpering. She tells Daniel to go rescue Richie, but Daniel has no success. It is during this period of time that Valeria and Daniel's relationship grows strained. She is constantly nagging at him for not trying to rescue Richie, and he is having second thoughts about leaving his wife. One night, they have an enormous fight, with the sounds of Richie trying to escape in the background. The next morning, Daniel tells Valeria he'll be home in a few hours. Valeria says she doesn't care if he never comes back at all. That night, Daniel comes home, but Valeria has locked him out of their bedroom. Daniel, not in the mood for a fight, decides to sleep on the couch. Later into the night, he demands to be let back in. He finally breaks down the door, and finds Valeria lying on the floor, unconscious. Daniel rushes her to the hospital, where her doctor explains that her leg eventually became infected with gangrene and had to be amputated. Daniel goes home that night, and after hearing Richie, tears apart the floor, until he finds the poor little dog, lying unconscious. The sounds he and Valeria had been hearing were actually some rats that inhabited the building. Valeria finally comes home, and is very upset. She goes to the window and takes Daniel's hand. The advertisement that had once had her picture on it is now gone, and the billboard is now up for rental.\nThe final story involves the vagrant, El Chivo. Chivo wanders the streets and collects the city's strays. Also, he is a part-time hitman. Early in the film, he shot a businessman in a restaurant in broad daylight. Later, he is reading the newspaper about the murder, and the paper states that no suspects have been found. On another page, Chivo reads the obituary of a woman. He begins to tear up, and goes to the funeral. He stands and watches the service from afar. An older woman at the funeral sees him, and escorts the deceased's daughter away. Then, the woman confront Chivo, and tells him to go away. It is revealed that the woman is his sister-in-law, and the young girl was his estranged daughter, who thinks that Chivo is dead. Through some explanations from a crooked cop, we learn that Chivo used to be a professor, but one day he went mad and joined the guerrillas. He left his wife and daughter and eventually was captured and served time in prison. When the cop found him, Chivo was nothing more than a wino, but the cop hired Chivo to do some hits, and Chivo was so good, that the cop keeps sending business his way. A new assignment comes up, and it involves a young businessman who wants his partner dead. Chivo asks for 100,000 upfront, and demands another 50,000 once the job is done. Chivo then begins to follow the partner around. One day, while standing at the corner of a street, Chivo sees two cars collide (Octavio and Valeria). Chivo rushes over to Octavio's car, and helps Octavio out. Octavio has broken his leg, and has some gashes to his head, but Jorge is killed. He also swipes Octavio's money and wallet and even takes the wounded Cofi back to his hideaway. Chivo nurses Cofi back to health. He also makes several attempts to establish contact with his daughter, but nothing comes of it. He even breaks into her apartment when she is not there, and steals a graduation picture of her, her mother, and her stepfather. Chivo goes to a photo booth, takes some pictures of his shaggy and weathered face, and places his photo over the face of the stepfather. As he passes the photo booth, Chivo sees Ramiro, with Susana and their baby. Ramiro finally decides to rob the bank with his buddy, and is almost successful, until an off-duty cop rushes in and shoots Ramiro, killing him. At his funeral, Octavio, now bald with cuts on his head and being supported by crutches, confronts Susana, and tells her that he is leaving that weekend, and that he'll wait for her. Susana says no, that Octavio doesn't get it, and finally declares that the unborn child will be named Ramiro. A few days later, Octavio waits at the bus station for her, but she never shows. Octavio does not get onto the bus.\nOne day, Chivo comes home and finds Cofi, with blood all over him. Chivo rushes to the back of his hideaway and finds his other dogs are dead, killed by Cofi. Chivo is so torn up about this, he pulls out his gun and is about to shoot Cofi, but can't bring himself to do it. He burns the remains of the other dogs, and decides to carry out the hit. He apprehends the partner at a Blockbuster, and takes him back to his hideaway. Chivo ties the partner up against a pole, and leaves him there for a few days, yet does not kill him. Chivo then contacts the businessman and tells him to come to the hideaway. The businessman shows up with the rest of the money, but is shocked to see his partner still alive. Chivo quickly turns the tables, and ties the businessman up as well. Chivo then learns that the two men are not only partner, but brothers as well. The next morning, Chivo awakes and shaves and cuts his hair. He steals the businessman's suit, and leaves the two there, still tied up loosely, but places a loaded gun between them, so they will kill each other. He stops at the photo booth and takes another picture, this time with his cleaned up face. Chivo takes Cofi and they go back to Chivo's daughter's apartment. Using the businessman's cell phone, Chivo calls his daughter's phone and leaves a message, saying how sorry he is that he wasn't there for her, and that he loves her. He then takes out the graduation photo, and puts the new photo on top of the old one. He then sells the businessman's SUV to a chopshop, and wanders into the unknown, with Cofi by his side.",

                "There is a character in 'Amores perros' who looks like Karl Marx.  He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles.  Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.El Chivo is the soul of the film, the missing link, both in appearance (a man called 'The Goat', who has rejected the civilities of society and lives a beast-like existence with his dogs, amongst the ruins of civilisation), and narrative function.  With intricate structure, 'Amores perros' tells three stories, one of underclass Mexican life, where survival depends on what New Labour calls 'illegal economies' (dog-fighting, bank-robbing etc.), where bright young women are stifled and degraded by thoughtless pregnancies and brutal marriages, where single mothers depend (and usually can't depend) on shiftless sons for subsistence; and this world's mirror opposite, the world of the media, of celebrity, of models and magazine editors, of daytime TV, perfume advertising campaigns and bright apartments.  Family life is central here too, although in this case it is torn apart by more pleasanntly bourgeois ailments like ennui and dissatisfaction.These two stories are mediated by the narrative of El Chivo, the man who left one of these worlds for the other, but who still negotiates the two, through his search for the daughter he left as a toddler, and in his 'job', wiping out businessman.  If Mexico is emerging as part of the super-confident globalism of high-capitalism, than El Chivo is the grizzly sore thumb, the ex-Sandinista, the Marx lookalike, the man who said no, the drop-out, the forgotten, the depleted spirit of the Left,  happily killing and torturing the servants of the new economic regime.There is something Biblical about his hirsute ascetism too, presuming to judge the 'Cain and Abel' half-brothers, one an adulterer, the other with a contract out on his sibling, another example of family gone badly wrong. This, the bleak funeral and grave scenes, and Octavia's functional crossing himself every time he passes an icon on the landing, are the sole residual elements of religion in a society once ostentatiously religious.Except for the director.  Like Paul Thomas Anderson in 'Magnolia', although to a less self-conscious degree, Gonzales Inarritu is the God of his film, intricately creating the structure that links his characters and their different environments.  These are negative connections, however, which work against the idea of coherent meaning in life - contact usually results in destruction (physical, material, spiritual), or diminishing.He is also an Old Testament god, punishing those who would get too confident with their future plans or their seemingly inviolable present success - the gains of capitalism are prey to the violent whims of chance: Gonzalez Inarritu doesn't need frogs to shake a rigid society or mindset.Moral change is linked to physical change - being beaten up, losing a leg, cutting hair.  The punning title, with its reference to the dog-eat/fight-dog nature of modern life, and its general unsatisfactoriness, also gives the film its Biblical feel, the idea of Mexico as an asphalt desert, or a rubbish heap, with all these scrawny mutts scavenging the remains.'Amores perros' shares  the sickly, bleached near-monochrome look of many recent crime films, like 'Chopper' or 'Bleeder'.  But where the heightened mise-en-scene in those works were expressionistic projections of their protagonists' psychosis, here it's part of a controlling world-view, the universal consciousness that creates, connects and destroys.\nThe three stories, though connected narratively and symbolically, are mutually distinct - the first is an exhilirating mix of violent gangster film and frustrated romance; the second is like a short story (the screenwriter is a novelist), a figurative plot where movement is through image, symbol and idea, rather than film narrative; the third is a kind of spiritual journey, with an appropriately Biblical (or Wim Wenders-like) openness.'Amores perros' is not quite as amazing as its admirers claim - it says more about contemporary cinema that a film only has to hold your interest for it to be a masterpiece - but it is consistently enthralling, and, despite all the stylistic tics and brutal violence, bracingly humanist.",

                "Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's debut feature film 'Amores Perros' to me is one of the most remarkable film debuts there is in terms of direction and as an overall film. While he hasn't made a bad film (his weakest 'Babel' is still very good), even if some of his films are very divisive, 'Amores Perros' to me is his best.It is a long film but don't let that put you off, 'Amores Perros' makes the most of the running time and rarely does it feel drawn out or overlong. The middle act is quite as good as the rest of the film, the pacing drags a bit but not enough to bring the film down too much. The first story is absorbing but even better is the magnificent last one. Even if they are purposely not likable the characters are compellingly real.Visually, 'Amores Perros' is a very well made film. Very atmospherically lit, edited and designed. Not a fan of the hand held camera technique but it's very cleverly used here, with an intriguing documentary-like style, and is not abused. It's beautifully scored too.Scripting is complex and absorbing, and the way 'Amores Perros', exploring love, desire, desperation and traumas, is told and constructed allows for many disturbing, shocking, suspenseful and moving moments. It's very thought-provoking too and has real immediacy, as well as hard-hitting emotional power, vast emotional range and is uniquely twisted. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's direction is exemplary, even early on his style is well established.Acting is very good, especially Emilio Echevarr\u00eda.Overall, a masterful feature film debut and a masterpiece in its own right. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

                "Some people just won't want to sit through this film because of the overtly graphic and disturbing dog fighting scenes, which is ironic, because most people don't seem to mind the graphic violence involving the people in this film. Others simply won't watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\"). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, \"Amores Perros\" is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget.",

                "'Amores Perros' impressed the hell out of me. Three interrelated tales of the darker side of life in contemporary Mexico City, each one as fresh and as fascinating as the last. Each of the three stories are dark, disturbing and filled with humanity. Superbly acted all round, but especially noteworthy is the standout performance by Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo, a political dissident turned hitman, and if the charismatic Gael Garcia Bernal (Octavia, the lovesick dog fighter) isn't an international star in the making I'll eat my words. This brilliant movie shows up the mediocrity of most current Hollywood \"product\", and to my mind ranks with a small handful of movies made this decade ('Chopper', 'The Pledge', 'The Way Of The Gun') that are truly memorable and with genuine substance. This one is a winner and essential viewing for all movie lovers. A future classic.",

                "This Mexican movie was surprisingly good. I confess the sin of prejudice concerning Mexican cinema, this being maybe the second Mexican film I have ever seen, but here my sins are punished. This is the work of a director of big talent. Hopefully, he will not be spoiled by the success.\nThree different stories in today's Mexico mix with very few common elements. The characters belong to different social categories, and nothing connects them at first sight, excepting the feeling of un-happiness, and - yes - dogs. Dogs play an important role in all three stories. One more warning - there is a lot of cruelty including dog fights - this film is certainly not for sensitive animal lovers. Directing is excellent, the stories are human and complex and despite their melodramatic or sometimes tragic outcome, they still leave you with a shade of hope - maybe because the humanity that the author uses to create his characters. There are so many memorable scenes, that I would commit another sin to pick any and describe it here - just rent, or go to watch this movie in the theater - it is worth all 150 or so minutes you will spend. 9/10 on my personal scale.",

It's so exceptionally well created that one little action creates a havoc in the lives of 3 different people, people who have no relation with each other. It seems relatable now considering how single pandemic Corona virus is changing peoples lives mostly for bad.

                "A young man gets into the world of illegal dog fighting in order to get enough money together to be able to run away with his brother's wife, but in the meantime he starts tension with another dog owner. A beautiful young model signs a lucrative contract with a perfume company and moves into her new flat with her lover \u0096 only for her tragedy to strike and her dog to go missing. Finally an ex-convict and guerrilla mourns the wife he left decades ago and longs to meet the daughter who thinks he is dead \u0096 but is also contracted to kill a businessman. These three lives come together in a car crash that acts as a catalyst in changing their lives.After seeing 21 Grams I knew that I had to get round to seeing this film. With it's appearance on TV (BBC4 showing itself to really be a 'place to think' and a wonderful channel to have) I took the opportunity to watch it, expecting a film that would match the good things I had heard about it. >From the opening car chase that results in the crash that the film spirals outwards from like debris, through for most of the first hour, I was hooked \u0096 the pace was great and the story gripping. It was violent, exciting and yet had a human element to it as well. However the second story knocked the wind out of it for a moment, and seemed to lack the emotion of the first. It was based around an urban myth of sorts and wasn't as good \u0096 even if it did pick up towards the end.The third story saw it return to a much more involving story of pain and the grinding out of life (as in 'getting by'). Maybe it was the rich lifestyles of the characters in story two that stopped me caring as much \u0096 I don't know but I know that the contrast between one & two made it more obvious how much the pace had dropped \u0096 especially when we are left wanted to know what happened to the characters we had spent an hour getting to care about. Anyway, the third story is a satisfying ending to the film and drew me back in emotionally where the second story had cut me off by it's abrupt start. Story two finishes before story three begins, and therefore it was easier to move on.I think the problem with this film for me was not the fact that three stories were intermingled but that I didn't think they were actually mixed well \u0096 the way the film moves away from characters before concluding their section (eg Octavia), the way the stories are actually quite separate from one another, these things and other I felt weakened the films \u0096 although each story was strong on it's own I just felt that story 2 was such a change to the film that it hurt it.However, as a film debut this is an amazing piece of work and is relentlessly impressive. From the opening car chase to the dog fights to the silent pain of the model looking out where her image once hung \u0096 in all these different moments I thought he did a great job and visually the film was never dull once no matter if it was set in a penthouse flat or a basement of an old building with the blood of dead dogs. And while we're on the subject, at the time of release I heard critics say they walked out of the film, refusing to watch cruelty to animals even being simulated. I can see their point but also think that they missed the fact that the animals in the film are mostly loved (even if they mostly die!) \u0096 however it is love and compassion for other humans that the film shows the characters having difficulty with, and this is where the emotional impact of the film is \u0096 not in simulated dogfights, albeit very well simulated dogfights that are hard to hear even if they are mostly unseen.The cast were all natural but I always find it hard to judge performances when they are not in English. Having said that, there were no bad performances in the whole thing \u0096 even if some have better material to work with than others. Of course I still think this is a director's film and the cast often take second place to the style and the feel of the film.Overall I really enjoyed this film but don't believe it deserves to be considered one of the 'best films ever made\u0099'! The opening hour is superb and it's pace is relentless (even in more sensitive moments) but the sudden stop the film makes when it changes to story two is too much to stand and really caused the film to stutter for me. It gets better and is fully back on track for story three but there are problems running all through the narrative. Even though it has a lower rating on IMDb at time of writing, I'd still say that 21 Grams offer this same fragmented style but with a much more satisfying narrative. Regardless of my nit picking I still think this is a powerful film that makes 150 minutes fly by with a huge amount of style from the first-time director, even if it does not live up to the endlessly gushing praise lavished upon it by many viewers.",

                "Thanks to contributors, plot synopsis has been very well written. Amores Perros is included in the most important movies for the beginning of the 21st century. It marked a new epoch with its thoroughly life-like vision on a twist of fate. Then in a 5 years' of time within more recognized movies, we started seeing similar plot schemes telling different stories over accidents that binds each person's fate. One of them was Crash, and it won the best picture Oscar in 2005.The more you see this film over and over again you'll get to a deeper point where the lives and choices of the characters won't matter any more. It's still affecting in the first-time watch, but with an examining view the next time you see it; you're driven into a vision, a cast of mind.There were 3 main characters and 3 main stories from each one, which are nested altogether. If we look at these stories over the characters' relationships with their dogs, it's intriguing. As if the dogs exemplify their owners: 1' Young loafer Octavio commits crime in order to earn money to make a living. He fights his dog Cofi in dog-fighting tournaments. How Cofi needs to fight for his life, so does need Octavio to commit crime for his life.2' In the second story, beautiful model Valeria receives a surprise gift from her fianc\u00e9 to choose a puppy from a pet store. By time, the puppy gets used to live a super-luxury pet life; which is the same life style of her owner. Valeria and her fianc\u00e9's apartment unit is under a hardwood flooring construction. One day while alone at home the puppy falls into a gap between the hardwood and the concrete; thus stays stuck there and began to squawk, since she is not used to live without comfort. At the same day her owner Valeria gets involved in a car accident while driving alone, having no one to help her just as happened to her puppy. She loses her leg in this accident and her luxury life comes to an end, as same as the life of her puppy. She begins complaining like her puppy squawking.3' In the last story, the grim hit-man El Chivo saves the life of Octavio's dog Cofi, after Octavio gets killed in the traffic accident in which Valeria lost her leg. Saving him changes Cofi's life, he no longer needs to fight for Octavio's bets on dog-fighting. His life becomes safe and peaceful. El Chivo starts looking after Cofi beside his other dogs. Among the other dogs Cofi looks very ugly and dirty. One day when El Chivo leaves the dogs together at home, Cofi kills every one of them. His reason of killing all the dogs explains why his owner is a hit-man. As Cofi killed innocent dogs; El Chivo kills innocent people for El Chivo seeing himself ugly,dirty and strange among the people; like his dog feeling himself ugly,dirty and strange among the dogs. El Chivo feels bad about his dogs, when he finds out Cofi has killed them. Yet, he feels worse about himself when he actually realizes that Cofi's attitude gave him a lesson of life. Then El Chivo shaves, cuts his beard and hair, gets cleaned up and turns out looking like a gentleman. Cofi's attitude changes his life; his life becomes safe and peaceful just as when El Chivo saved Cofi's life.The vision we're getting when we compare these 3 stories is about the public loneliness of an individual. The only person, who can guide and who can help us, is ourselves. This loneliness brings our freedom of choices. With making our own choices, we build the essence of our character: Our quintessences. Life is sum of all our choices. In order to build our quintessences; we always face the risk, fear and pressure of the chance of making a wrong choice. Life makes it obligatory to make choices. This obligatory builds our inner crisis and develops our personality. To find the secrets of our own personality, we try to find someone or something else to lay a burden on the responsibility of self-search. Here in Amores Perros, the 3 main characters are used by their self-search reflection on their dogs.Doesn't this vision form the idea of Jean Paul Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\"? Since Amores Perros hides the character views through the situations created by dogs; it is a movie that has no characters, but only situations. This is the systematic of Existentialism. If there was no situation or happening, there wouldn't have been any characters. Existence precedes essence. A person is nothing without his actions. So, a person doesn't have a soul(or a character) if he is not alive. Then there wasn't and won't be anything before and after our lives. If we don't believe in this vision, certainly the signs of fate that we come across in our lives must be delusion.",

                "True to the structure, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu attacks the subject of love with a multi-pronged approach, addressing three different stages, or complications, common in `love.'  All three storylines represent the `struggling' aspect of love.  It would be fair to say that Amores Perros, roughly translated to be `Love's a Bitch,' makes the ultimate statement, `Love is a struggle.' More specifically, however, Octavio's narrative can be most suitably seen as the `hunt for love' and acquisition or fight for it.  To be with his love, Susana, he must overcome both the fact that his brother is married to her and the fact that his dreams of leaving the city are hamstrung by his less than admirable socio-economic state.  Daniel and Valeria, who are about fifteen to twenty years Octavio and Susana's elders, represent love's most frustrating peak - when one is already in it and wants or needs to get out, for better of for worse.  Daniel is trying to get out of a marriage in which he has kids to be with the supermodel, Valeria, a woman whose meaning to him is ultimately superficial.  El Chivo, whose story is a perfect compliment to Daniel's, represents distance and alienation from love, inwardly looking at it from the outside.  He has abandoned his family twenty years prior to become a guerilla terrorist and now operates as a vagabond hit man.  It would be difficult to look at these three different `stages' of love in a classically structured film.  The episodic structure eases us between each stage, at no point forcing us to tolerate the unrealistic concept of one couple going through all of these stages.  Breaking it up into three different narratives, each revolving around different characters, presents the audience with the ability to view each story as independent the others, a more pervasive perspective.However, this film is not a simple three-part love story.  In Amores Perros, violence is akin to love.  Each character displays this brutally: El Chivo leaves his love to be a terrorist; Octavio engages his dog in violence and even attempts murder to provide money for his love; Daniel and Valeria's relationship is verbally and nearly physically volatile to the point where they hate each other.  Each character's love for another character is manifested in their violent acts.  This is an interesting theme considering the paradoxical relationship between love and violence, one of which is the induction of harm, the other which is the polar opposite.  This juxtaposition of love and violence, if for no other reason, is meant to show the impulsive nature of love.  We take it for granted as a compassionate, helping characteristic of life but I\u00f1\u00e1rritu reveals his characters through this juxtaposition, allowing the audience to consider the consequences of love that are otherwise unforeseen.I\u00f1\u00e1rritu does a lot of things right in this film.  Mainly, he keeps us in constant suspense through the causality of the plot, forcing us to anticipate the results of the characters' actions.  This causality can be as brazen as Octavio's decision to stab Jarocho, inevitably leading one into apprehension over what will happen to Octavio.  Less obviously, however, is the way he creates suspense around Daniel and Valeria.  Their whole relationship is characterized by conflict.  While this makes for good dialogue, it insists upon a boiling point - one that is anticipated throughout the entire length of their chapter.  Likewise, there is delicate suspense over what Valeria's disfigurement will mean for their relationship. Not only is Daniel forced to confront whether or not Valeria's beauty is the only thing keeping them together, but Valeria must adjust to living without her beauty.  Suspense revolves around El Chivo from the moment he first comes onto screen.  We see him.  He murders someone.  We're back to the story of Octavio.  The entire first two hours of the movie beg of an answer as to who this man is and what he has to do with the subject of the film.  We later find out, not only does he have everything to do with it; he makes the film, seeking redemption on behalf of every other love-torn character.  The type of monologue Emilio Echevarria's character, El Chivo, delivers at the end of the film would have a completely different meaning in a film without an episodic structure, in which case he would only be seeking redemption for himself.  However, the way I\u00f1\u00e1rritu cross cuts between El Chivo and the other characters, in all their woe - the consequences of their actions, applies greater meaning to El Chivo's words and actions in the final scene.Perhaps where we get some of the most important information about the characters, and Amores Perros as a whole, is through what is representative. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu makes steady use of symbols and motifs throughout the film, some of which work well, lending themselves nicely to the dramatic structure of the film, others failing to enhance the story.  For example, the massive Enchant billboard looming above Valeria's apartment like the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg is one of the more lackluster motifs in the film.  First, we are unavoidably asking, `Why they would want to live under that thing in the first place?  Second, the removal of the billboard coinciding with the fall of Valeria's career, Daniel's self-assurance, their relationship, whatever you want to intuit, is much to explicit for this film.  The more understated motifs such as the recurring telephone ring, `Bueno?.Bueno?' someone always answers, come off better.  This repetition is telling of the deception and unfaithfulness rampant in this world.  It works.  Another representative device that supplements the story is how the dogs act as metaphors for their respective owners.  El Chivo's dogs are the very embodiment of him.  They are all strays much the same way he is a vagrant.  Cofi, Octavio's rottweiler is equivalent to Octavio in his impulsive and aggressive behavior.  This is displayed in Cofi most notably during the fight scenes, but we see it particularly in Octavio when he head-butts his brother, Ramiro, and when he stabs Jarocho in the stomach and thereby provoking the car chase.  Valeria's dog, Richie, is lost under the floorboards, confined for most of this narrative.  Valeria is physically much the same way, confined to her wheelchair.  More implicitly, she is confined to a life that has been propped up around her by people who idolize, envy, or lust after her.  Valeria's death is also parallel to her dog's death in that they both die from their respective internment, Valeria being trapped in a room and too immobile to save herself, Richie trapped in the floor and too exhausted to fend off armies hungry rats.  The motifs and metaphors within each narrative help structure them as self-contained bodies.The episodic structure of Amores Perros could have been damaging to the film had it not been for the inspired way the stories overlap only so much as to not exasperate the audience.  In the three stories, rarely does a character from one interact with a character from another, outside the unifying car crash scene.  There are truly only two occurrences: when El Chivo, sword in hand, scares off a frustrated Jarocho who plans to sic his dog on one of El Chivo's, and when Valeria appears on a Mexican morning show broadcast into Octavio's home the morning of the accident.  This interaction was all that was needed for Amores Perros to be successful as an episodic film.  Its structure lends itself well to subject matter and storyline.  I\u00f1\u00e1rritu tells it to us this way; the literary devices at use bring it to life and its structure gives it legs to move.  Throughout it, so well crafted, one can mentally fuse all three stories together and see one single character going through the process of fighting for love, realizing what a trivial pursuit it is, abandoning it, and then spending the rest of his life trying to touch it from behind the bars self-guilt.",

                "Director Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu heralded the Mexican New Wave cinema with Amores Perros.Between 2010 to 2020. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and Guillermo del Toro have won 5 Best Director Oscars between them.Amores Perros in some ways has a beginning reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs. It has a dog bleeding profusely in the back of a car instead of Mr Orange who has just been shot.The rest of the film has a jumbled narrative. A bit like Pulp Fiction. However that is where the similarities end.A car crash in the streets of Mexico links three set of stories.The first story is about Octavio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) who lusts after his sister in law Susana. She is married to his older brother Ramiro who brutalises her. Already pregnant with a second child. Octavio enters the world of dog fights to earn enough money to run away with her.Luckily the dog he has is a beast who beats all comers. However a rival hoodlum does not like Octavio, his older brother and the dog. That is the catalyst which leads to the car chase and the eventual crash.The second story concerns rising model Valeria. She has just moved into a luxury apartment with her older married lover. Disaster strikes as she is badly injured in a car crash. When she arrives home with a severely injured leg. Her dog disappears under the floorboards.The third story concerns El Chivo. He is in the periphery of society and has a tangential role in the first two parts of the story.He is a tramp who roams the streets with his cart and a pack of dogs. He rushes to aid Octavia in the aftermath of the car accident.It also turns out that El Chivo was once a well respected academic. A family man who became a revolutionary and was then jailed. After leaving prison, he became a hitman but now sees things differently when he reads news that his ex wife has died.This is a full throated movie. It is a visceral study of the working class and the underclass of Mexico.The dog fighting scenes although short can be off putting for some. Octavio is one of the nicer people in the movie. Ramiro is not only rough with his wife. Despite working in a supermarket he is also a violent robber.Although Valeria represents the aspirational celebrity strata. Her story is an allegory.The dog being lost underneath the floorboards that is crawling with rats shows how easy it is to slide down. Valeria loses modelling work and her lover wants to get back with his wife. Being with an injured scarred model was not the life he was hoping for.The more intriguing story was that of El Chivo and his transformation. His realisation that he should had been there for his family.Despite the harshness of life there is a moral undertone to Amores Perros. It is a confident gritty full feature debut by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. The film could had done with being tighter especially with the middle story.The interlinked narrative was used again by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in Babel.",

                "I think we're talking about one of the best Mexican films ever (i say so, knowing there's been excellent Luis Bu\u00f1uel films as well as Arturo Ripstein ones, like 'Principio y Fin' -Begining and End- that is this director's highest peak (based on the book by Naguib Mafusz)and Emilio 'El Indio' Fernandez ones that i don't personally like that much (even though he received the Golden Bear in the 'Berlinale').Being surrounded by terrible Mexican movies, 'Amores Perros' was so refreshing and remarkably above every expectation that everybody could have about a first-time director (even though he was well-known for his wonderful work at advertising (changing the way ads were made in Mexico) and as a radio DJ in a WFM radio station that contributed to change radio in Mexico, too, along with Rock 101. Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu (in cooperation with his almost personal screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga) creates such a complex yet flawless history based on three individual ones that converge not only in the dantesque (reference to Dante Alighieri's style, The Divine Comedy) car accident, but in their perception and description of how love can be harsh, as well as life itself, of how love can get to be a bitch, a struggle.First Story ('Octavio y Susana') is about Octavio's (Garcia Bernal) obsession with his sister-in-law, Susana (Vanessa Bauche), but it's also about the violence, about an illusion, about betrayal, about loss. This is also reflected in the character of Octavio's dog, Cofi in a parallel relationship with his owner while he seeks his own destiny, having lost everything, he'll have to redefine his life. This parallelism also occurs in the second story('Daniel y Valeria'), an almost surreal one, where Ritchie being trapped underneath the condo's floor represents how it's owner Valeria (Goya Toledo) is trapped in a relation with Daniel that grows sicker as her injury (caused by the car accident) gets worse. The removal of the gigantic advertising of 'Enchant', the scent campaign that she used to be the image for, from the view of her balcony represents their decline: Daniel (Avaro Guerrero) left behind his marriage for this superficial mirage kind of dream, and she will have to make a whole redefinition of her life after losing everything. The dog-character parallelism with the main characters of this film can also be noticed in the third story ('El Chivo y Maru'), where 'El Chivo' (Emilio Echevaria), a former College teacher that left it all, family included, to become some guerrilla terrorist (is there a symbolism for Subcommander Marcos, from EZLN?), and now finds, by losing it all (all of his dogs being killed), but finding a new reason, new company just before a hit-man-type mission where he sets a confrontation between two brothers in such a biblical style the chance that none of the characters from the rest of the stories had: redemption. That's when he decides to retrieve some of the things he has lost, like Maru (Lourdes Echevarria -Emilio's actual daughter in real life), by at least apologizing to her, and redeeming himself finding a new life. It's clear that he'll stop being a homeless, because by the end of the movie he's got plenty of money. This story is one step ahead of the other two, cause after the loss they are all victims of, 'El Chivo' is the only one who gets that chance to start from scratch once again. Huge merit to Emilio Echevarria's performance for making believable the only character that was in risk of not being plausible of the film. Because of the relation within the characters, their dogs and their own love personal story, the title is, too a big success (both in Spanish and in English). Of the episodic narrative structure of the movie (a few critics in the Cannes Film Festival compared it with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction), it can be said that besides making it more beautiful and complex, it's also necessary. One can't figure a way to resolve the situation other than this one. The thrill, the shock would never be the same. For example, if each one was a short film instead, it wouldn't work the same way as the whole movie.In the film, Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu allows himself to appear a few times: in the editorial where Daniel works, for example, verifying a magazine cover; having some of the TV spots he made in the 90's when he was a publicist shown in the movie; and in the last scene, 'El Chivo' names the dog he rescued (formerly known as Cofi) as 'El Negro', I\u00f1arritu's nickname.",

                "If like me, you were dazzled by this year's \"Babel\", you will likely be as curious as I was to check out the first film in director Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's trilogy about death. Similar in narrative structure to \"Babel\", this viscerally shattering 2000 movie carries three overlapping stories tied together by a defining car accident. Written with dramatic precision by Guillermo Arriaga (who later wrote the other two films in the trilogy, \"21 Grams\" and \"Babel\"), all three take place within the different social strata of Mexico City, and as the title implies (English translation: \"Love's a Bitch\"), dogs are intriguingly pivotal to each story. Also like \"Babel\", the various interconnections among the stories do not come across as contrived but rather as emotional resonant in a gradually revelatory manner. Even though the movie runs an epic length of 153 minutes, it consistently holds your attention.The first plot line, \"Octavio and Susana\", is about a love triangle that occurs between young Octavio, his abusive older brother Ramiro and Ramiro's wife Susana. Dog fighting is common sport in their downscale neighborhood, and the brothers own a rottweiler that's a natural aggressor in the fight pit. Octavio sees the dog as his meal ticket to steal Susana away from Ramiro and escape to Juarez. The second story, \"Daniel and Valeria\", focuses on Daniel, a married, guilt-ridden TV producer who buys a fancy new condo for him to live with his tempestuous supermodel girlfriend Valeria. Their relationship unravels in light of the car accident, and further complications occur when her little dog is trapped underneath the floorboards. The third story, \"El Chivo and Maru\", is about former political revolutionary El Chivo who has years ago left his family and became a hit man for hire. Living in squalor with a herd of homeless dogs, he is recruited by a businessman to kill his partner, both of whom turns out to be brothers. The integration of these stories is handled with supple dexterity in a non-linear fashion that allows the viewer to peel off the layers of the characters in order to understand their common dilemmas.Unbelievably, this powderkeg of a film represents I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's feature film debut as a director, and his confidence and audacity are felt throughout although the third episode seems too deliberate a pastiche of \"Pulp Fiction\". He has assembled a superb cast with Emilio Echevarr\u00eda the standout as the grizzled El Chivo, a scarifying vagrant who reveals himself to be a troubled soul who is the only one who successfully escapes his trying existence. In his first major role, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal portrays Octavio with escalating emotional fervor; and as Susana and Ramiro, Vanessa Bauche and Marco P\u00e9rez provide powerful support. Together, they generate a palpable sense of imminent violence throughout their episode. Goya Toledo makes a vivid impression as Valeria, fully capturing her spoiled character's misplaced sense of entitlement, while Alvaro Guerrero affectingly humanizes the put-upon Daniel's increasing regret. Just as he would prove later with \"The Motorcycle Diaries\", \"Brokeback Mountain\" and \"Babel\", Rodrigo Prieto showcases superbly evocative cinematography that is in keeping with the emotional shadings of the story.The 2001 DVD provides a surprising number of extras beginning with an informative, often meticulous commentary track by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Arriaga (spoken in Spanish and subtitled in English). There are three quick featurettes. The first is a six-minute short that shows how the numerous dogs used in the film were trained and protected during the production. Considering how realistically violent the dog fighting scenes are, I find this short helpfully reassuring. The second is the standard, making-of featurette, about fifteen minutes long. Even though I\u00f1\u00e1rritu seems to be promoting the film as well as explaining the genesis of it, there is good behind-the-scenes footage, including some interesting table readings from the cast. This leads to one quick short about the staging of the car accident itself. Also included are about a dozen deleted scenes, totaling about fifteen minutes, which actually help provide context in understanding some of the characters' motivations. There are also three music videos from the movie's soundtrack, which is a dramatically effective mix of Mexican and Spanish rock-rap tracks.",

                "Becoming one of the most well-regarded and unique filmmakers of the modern era, Mexican born director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu started his career off in exemplary fashion with his Oscar nominated and critically praised multi-narrative drama Amores Perros, a hard-hitting experience that was a sign of things to come for the future Oscar winner.Spanning three separate stories, all interconnected through an horrific car crash and a shared bond with a four legged friend, Amores Perros is both an unflinching look at love and life in Mexico, as our various flawed individuals (all of whom aren't likable as such but remain humanistic in their behaviors and decision making) find their lives unraveling around them to various degrees.Our first introduction to this world is through Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal's Octavia and his pursuit of Vanessa Bauche's Susana, a pursuit that leads him into the dangerous and horrific world of dog fighting, as we are then welcomed into the world of Goya Toledo's supermodel Valeria and then Emilio Echevarr\u00eda vagrant El Chivo, a man more at home with dogs than his own kind.There's barely an ounce of respite from the unending relentlessness of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's examinations of the harsh realities of love and life in the troubled country of his birth, championed by Guillermo Arriaga's rugged script (a partnership that would spawn 21 Grams and Babel also) and D.O.P Rodrigo Prieto's documentary like filming style, giving Amores Perros a rough and raw veneer but also one that has been clearly designed for the purpose at hand.Not many films before or since I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's exercise in consistent bombardment of life's troubles have managed to capture the frenetic nature of every day life and every day struggles, particularly south of the border, with the films first 60 minutes in particular hugely impressive, even more so when you consider this was the directors first feature film effort.Filled with abundant energy and intrigue around Octavia and Susana's potentially elopement, Amores Perros never truly reaches its early heights again as Valeria's story strand in particular suffers from a sense of over indulgence and El Chivo's more over the top story strand taking some time to get use to.There's no doubt there's elements of each stories importance and emotional resonance but it's a shame Amores Perros couldn't maintain the early pace it sets, a facet I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was able to iron out with his future efforts, most notably in Birdman and The Revenant, films that managed to combine all the best elements of the director in one cohesive package.Final Say -A tough watch that set the tone for Alejandro G.

                "'Amores Perros' is a shocking experience from visionary director Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu. It's a difficult film to watch, one which continuously challenges its audience, but a reward in of itself for those who can withstand its brutality. It puts a magnifying glass to the pain of love, and those who are destroyed by it. It gives new meaning to the film title's literal translation, 'love is a bitch'.In a single moment in time, several lives in Mexico City will be changed forever by a devastating car crash. The film divides itself into three separate segments: representing the past, present, and future. Octavio is searching for recognition and love, but looks in the wrong places. It's a desire that drives him, leading him to make choices in life that will soon haunt him. Valerie, whose life is most impacted by the car accident, finds herself living in a relationship that's crumbling and self-destructing. El Chivo must deal with the absence of his daughter, and the void it's left in his life. He finds companionship in the dogs he picks up off the street, and they soon become the only living things he can connect with. Together, the lives of these individuals will collide in more ways than one. They will find themselves connected by a single thread: love. And the hell that can be unleashed with it.When I finished watching 'Amores Perros', one of the first things that popped into my mind was why 'Babel' couldn't have been this good. Where 'Babel' lacked in emotional depths and highs, 'Amores Perros' at times finds itself drowning in it. It's a visceral and gritty film, so raw and intense. You may think you've seen it all, but 'Perros' will challenge even those who are rarely phased by cinema. You may find it difficult not to look away at times. I\u00f1arritu's movie has been described as being a 'dog holocaust', and at times I can't disagree. The film's sheer violence is so penetrating and disturbing, it packs a mighty punch. And while this film is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart, there's no question that 'Amores Perros' has a tender heart and message ready to be heard. I\u00f1arritu crafts a compelling story from start to finish, which strips down to the bare basics. His ability to capture a piece of the human spirit is wondrous, even if it doesn't always cast us in the best light. It's dark, fierce, and relentless, but nothing short of greatness.'Amores Perros' features an array of actors and actresses, all of which work wonders in their respective roles. Gael Garcia Bernal is, as always, brilliant. It's a more restrained and less quirky role than many are used to seeing him in, but nonetheless has the rare ability to capture and audience's attention with ease. Emilio Echevarria stars as El Chivo, and delivers a haunting performance as a man who finds himself alone and saddened. It's the weakest part of the film, but is made up for by Emilio's wonderful presence. Goya Toledo plays Valerie, a celebrity crippled by the accident the film revolves around. I found her part in the story to be most interesting, if not for the fact of seeing the life of someone who goes from having it all to nothing at all. There are many numerous performances, too many to cover, but they all lend their talents to create something extraordinary.'Amores Perros' is an adrenaline rush for its entire running, which tops two-and-a-half hours. It's all a very human and primal film, which can be attributed to I\u00f1arritu's impeccable style and talent. Combining a mutli-faceted story with electric performances, 'Perros' works on many different layers to satisfying results. An original and bold step in film-making, this nearly perfect picture will have you experience a collage of emotions, and invest in flawed characters... all for the sake of love.",

                "Three stories are connected by a horrific car accident in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's feature film debut. All three stories also revolve, at least to some extent, around dogs (the title translates to Love's a Bitch, with \"Bitch\" having a double meaning). The three stories vary in interest, in my opinion, and I struggled by the end to connect them or really to care about any of them on a deep level. Still, it's a pretty entertaining flick and very strongly directed. In the first story, Gael Garcia Bernal stars as a young man who's in love with his older brother's wife. He decides to enter his rottweiler into a series of dog fights, but he runs up against an opponent who isn't keen on losing. In the second story, a model (Goya Toledo) moves in with her boyfriend, but their happiness is immediately destroyed by the aforementioned accident. During her recovery, her beloved terrier disappears into a hole in their apartment's hardwood floor and never comes back. In the third story, a hit-man (Emilio Echevarria) who poses as a bum has an existential crisis. I more or less preferred them in the order they played out, though even the first story has its flaws (am I really supposed to have much sympathy for a guy who participates in dog fights?).",

                "Spoilers herein.I believe that the future of film is now firmly in the hands of Spanish-speaking filmmakers. Not that they make the best films, but that they have the current crop of ideas. We saw Italians introduce us to the notion that a camera can be tethered to the soul of a character and follow him around. This is still the standard of the much celebrated Scorsese.The French were briefly interesting when to this they added the notion of reflexivity, where the mechanics of film-making became a character. Hollywood - in their more interesting films - extended this notion of folding to an amazing collection of ironic and self-referential devices.Meanwhile, Spanish literature was long incubating a synthesis of fabulism within self- reference (Cervantes invented the notion) combined with earthy sensuality, sometimes natural energy.So in contrast to the Scorsese-led `character' stuff, and the often mechanical Hollywood folding exercises, we get Spanish films from Medem, Almodovar and Garcia. Rodriguez is very much in this camp. And now this.Yes, it is overly long and uneven. Yes it is artificially gritty and has some dishonest performances. But it is extremely well constructed, both on a dramatic and conceptual level.Folding in this context is placed in the fantasy of rather than perspective or character. Why give several stories? Taratino does because Kar Wai Wong does, and his motive is to bleach the story away and focus on the musical texture of the mood. But Garcia does it (`Ten Tiny Love Stories,' `Things You Can Tell By Just Looking at Her.') to synthesize a single entity out of many and a single larger context out of the many sketched situations. The focus is on that larger context, and what magical dynamics are at work. It is pop cosmology as art drawn from drowning the soap opera content. It is new melodrama - melodrama is when the characters are puppets to external forces - with attention to interesting exposition and subterranean channels of those forces.Fate. Dogs as astrological entities.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

The rest of my time with Amores Perros was spent wondering why none of these people have caller ID, wondering whether this movie set some kind of record for most fake dead dogs in a film, wondering who El Chivo reminded me of (Il Duce from Boondock Saints), wondering why they just didn't cover the darn hole (who leaves gaping holes in the middle of their apartment floor?), and trying to think up a name for the dog (never came up with anything I liked more than Lost Dog).

                "I was really looking forward to this as I had heard all the hype about it off IMDb and managed to get it in a DVD sale for \u00a38. The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don't take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it's not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it's just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself 'it's only a movie and I am sure it won't take anything away from it' and thankfully it didn't. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don't usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn't really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother, mother and his brother's girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn't like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.When Octavio realises that he can make some money with his dog fighting so he can escape the slums of Mexico City. But it's not so easy as he wants to take his brother girlfriend and her baby with him but she takes some convincing. The other story is to do with Valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife and kids for her but the terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound and she loses her grip on wanting to enjoy her life and things start to become hard for her and her lover. But the only thing that is keeping her occupied is the love for her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath the floor boards. Valeria worries as there are Rats down there and doesn't seem to find a way of getting the dog out and as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting in. The last story is with El Chiro A homeless man with nothing in his life apart from his love for his own pet dogs. He also has a past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed to see his daughter after he walked out on the family but now is ex wife is dead he tries to make up for what he has done with the his daughter but the family do it's best to keep him away and obsolete from her life.The movie is very long and has a lot of unneeded scenes in it. I really wasn't taken in by the story of Valeria as it didn't seem very convincing and doesn't really go anywhere. You think it's just about to get interesting but at the last minute it has gone and it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out the entire screen as she doesn't make a difference. If I had it my own way then I would have kept the whole film focusing on Octavio and his dog Cofi trying their best to gather enough money to get out of there depressing lives and with El Chiro coming in in one or two scenes to make it a lot more interesting. This doesn't make Amores Perros a bad film just not a great one. You will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again. Its not the sort of film you go back and watch it again and again unless it intrigued you. Another good solid foreign film that didn't hit all the marks but still very good.",

                "The first ninety minutes of so of Amores Perros is magnificent. It would maybe even qualify as one of the greatest films of all time. Gael Garcia Bernal is incredible, perhaps his best role, and the cinematography complements the plot perfectly, full of dark and dirty shots. The dog fighting is intense and particularly well shot. The characters are real, the acting is believable and nuanced, the plot goes at a fast pace and I was gripped.Then the film changes course completely, to a film about a model and her unfaithful boyfriend who get caught up in the car crash. And the film dies right there. It becomes boring, stilted, uninteresting, and I found myself drifting away several times. The characters didn't intrigue me, the storyline was weak, and even when they brought the old man with the dogs and the beard into play it wasn't enough to save it. Watching the model cry 'Richie' over and over again while her dog was stuck under the floorboards bored the tears out of me, and it's a subplot and dialogue line that went on for nearly half an hour.They had something really special here and ruined it. This should have been edited down and the latter plot lines should have become minor distractions if they were included at all. It's such a waste of the groundwork laid early on; a masterpiece turned into an average film. I only watched on in the hope I'd see the conclusion to the initial plot. Y Tu Mama Tambien, The Motorcycle Diaries and La Mala Educacian are all better than this as far as the classic Gael Garcia Bernal films go.",

                "A movie shot in ugly, unsaturated greenish-black colours with a jiggly camera that shows dogs being ripped apart has three serious marks against it, right from the start.  It tries to harrow us with sheer length (two and a half hours is a long time under the circumstances), and in this it succeeds: after the truly horrible bit (in part three - you know the scene I'm referring to), I found myself taking an interest in the story at last, perhaps from a lack of anything better to do.  But it's too little, too late.  The three stories have nothing to do with one another (they coincide spatially at one point - big deal), and they're simply laid before us, without art, like three uncut, rotting slabs of reality TV.  If this film were a physical object there would be policemen standing around it saying, \"Move along, nothing to see here.\"  And they'd be right.",

Before his parents and sister head home to Virginia following the convocation, Chris, refusing his parents&#39; gift of a new car to replace his old Datsun which he states works perfectly fine, tells them that he has thoughts of going into Harvard Law, he having received excellent grades in what were largely classes focusing on global social consciousness. Walt, Billie and Carine will learn by the end of the summer that Chris had no intention of going to Harvard as he has since moved from his apartment in Atlanta without a word to them, he arranging with the post office to hold his mail for a couple of months before being &quot;returned to sender&quot; to give him a head start in his escape from his family. Chris&#39; Datsun is eventually discovered abandoned in the Arizona desert, the authorities believing it being done on purpose as opposed to Chris being abducted. Walt and Billie intend to continue to search for Chris until they know conclusively what has happened to him. Carine, having had much the same upbringing as Chris, believes she understands what he is doing in making this escape. What he has done is either donated most of his money to Oxfam or burned it, and has destroyed all of his ID in an effort to start life anew as a child of the Earth, he rechristening himself Alexander Supertramp. This move is in rebellion to much of western society, and most specifically against the type of life his parents epitomize, they who he believes should never have gotten married and are hypocrites in portraying what they believe society expects of them, being generally unhappy with each other and life in the process. He ultimately wants to live off the land, carrying with him only what material possessions he will need, but wants to experience freedom by traveling the country by thumbing rides or riding the rails, working the odd job until he earns enough to purchase what he needs at any give time, and obtaining some skills he knows he will need to survive in the destination he has in mind when he is ready: the wilds of Alaska. Despite stating that he does not want or need attachments, he does make some human connections along the way, and not necessarily to/with like-minded people."

        "synopsis": "The film is presented in a nonlinear narrative, cutting back and forth between McCandless' time spent in the Alaskan wilderness and his two-year travels leading up to his journey to Alaska. The plot summary here is told in a more chronological order.\nIn April 1992, Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) arrives in a remote area just north of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. Noting Chris' unpreparedness, the stranger who drops him off lends him a pair of boots. Chris travels into the wildness and sets up a campsite in an abandoned city bus, which he calls \"The Magic Bus\". At first, McCandless is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature around him, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts with a .22 caliber rifle, reads books, and keeps a diary of his thoughts as he prepares himself for a new life in the wild.\nTwo years earlier, in May 1990, McCandless graduates with high honors from Emory University. Shortly afterwards, McCandless rejects his conventional life by destroying all of his credit cards and identification documents. He donates nearly all of his savings to Oxfam and sets out on a cross-country drive in his Datsun B210 to experience life in the wilderness. McCandless does not tell his parents, Walt (William Hurt) and Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden), or his sister Carine (Jena Malone) what he is doing or where he is going. He refuses to keep in touch with them after his departure, causing his parents to become increasingly anxious and eventually desperate.\nAt Lake Mead, McCandless' car is caught in a flash flood, causing him to abandon it and begin hitchhiking. He burns what remains of his cash and assumes a new name: \"Alexander Supertramp.\" In Northern California, McCandless encounters a hippie couple named Jan Burres (Catherine Keener) and Rainey (Brian H. Dierker). Rainey tells McCandless about his failing relationship with Jan, which McCandless helps rekindle. In September, McCandless arrives in Carthage, South Dakota and works for a contract harvesting company owned by Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn). He is forced to leave after Westerberg is arrested for satellite piracy.\nMcCandless then travels on the Colorado River and, though told by park rangers that he may not kayak down the river without a license, ignores their warnings and paddles downriver until he eventually arrives in Mexico. There, his kayak is lost in a dust storm, and he crosses back into the United States on foot. Unable to hitch a ride, he starts traveling on freight trains to Los Angeles. Not long after arriving, however, he starts feeling \"corrupted\" by modern civilization and decides to leave. Later, McCandless is forced to resume hitchhiking, after he is beaten by the railroad police.\nIn December 1991, McCandless arrives at Slab City, California, in the Imperial Valley, and encounters Jan and Rainey again. There, he also meets Tracy Tatro (Kristen Stewart), a teenage girl who shows interest in McCandless, but he rejects her because she is underage. After the holidays, McCandless decides to continue heading for Alaska. One month later, while camping near Salton City, California, McCandless encounters Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook), a retired man who recounts the story of the loss of his family in a car accident while he was serving in the United States Army. He now occupies his time in a workshop as an amateur leather worker. Franz teaches McCandless the craft of leather-work, resulting in the making of a belt that details McCandless' travels. After spending two months with Franz, McCandless decides to leave for Alaska, despite this upsetting Franz, who has become quite close to McCandless. On a parting note, Franz gives McCandless his old camping and travel gear, along with the offer to adopt him as his grandchild, but McCandless simply tells him that they should discuss this after he returns from Alaska; then, he departs.\nFour months later, at the abandoned bus, life for McCandless becomes harder, and he begins to make poor decisions. As his supplies begin to run out, he realizes that nature is also harsh and uncaring. McCandless concludes that true happiness can only be found when shared with others, and he seeks to return from the wild to his friends and family. However, he finds that the stream he had crossed during the winter has become wide, deep, and violent due to the snow thaw, and he is unable to cross. Saddened, he returns to the bus. In a desperate act, McCandless is forced to gather and eat roots and plants. He confuses similar plants and eats a poisonous one, falling sick as a result. Slowly dying, he continues to document his process of self-realization and imagines his family for one last time. He writes a farewell to the world and crawls into his sleeping bag to die. Two weeks later, his body was found by moose hunters. Shortly afterwards, Carine returned to Virginia with her brother's ashes in her backpack.",

                "For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.Sean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can't stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he's great as a director, having seen his work in \"The Pledge\" and \"The Crossing Guard.\" The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays \"Chris McCandless\" (a.k.a. \"Alexander Supertramp\" reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.Two people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (\"Ron France\") again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn't acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as \"Tracy Tatro,\" who had a crush on \"Alex.\" This young woman is on her way to stardom.Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, \"Rainey\" and \"Jan.\" I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker's voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.Knowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don't remember them in the book but I'll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here. I thought the film was pretty kind to him. You read more in the book about how he hurt a lot of people with his silence. Either way, it's a a fascinating story and a beautiful film.",

                "Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.Emile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minutes\u0097with Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no license\u0097and it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.Hirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn't that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I'm even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God.",

                "INTO THE WILD definitely works as a film - I had read the book so I certainly knew the tragic story of this young man's life but I was blown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talent Emile Hirsch working with the old, legendary Hal Holbrook makes the film a must see - in fact, their scene near the end in the truck is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen on film - Holbrook is amazing there. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination (but probably won't get it). The film is by no means perfect - there are pacing problems but Penn does use the flashbacks incredibly well and the film builds power as it goes along. Hirsch is so real - I remember noticing how talented he was in the indie flick Dangerous Life Of Altar Boys and I also thought he was very good in the so-so Alpha Dog film. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter. I can see how this film might not be for every one, but I was very moved by it and days later - certain images and moments stayed with me.

                "Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) \"Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,\" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.I think some people are turned off by what they feel was a glorification, but I didn't feel that way at all. We see the trail of tears he leaves behind him, with his parents and sister devastated by not hearing from him, and him ignoring some of the kindly advice he receives along the way. He is also brutal to an old man (Hal Holbrook) who so very generously offers to adopt him, in what is a fantastic scene. Holbrook is also brilliant when he tells the young man \"when you forgive, you love.\" We see him take risks which pay off (kayaking down a rampaging river), and of course others which do not (going into the true wild of Alaska without a map or enough preparation). For that he is sometimes vilified or mocked, but I admired him for not conforming like the rest of us, and for living life on his own terms. He certainly was not cheated. And in the end, he has his moment of realization, that \"happiness (is) only real when shared\", which is a moment that is incredibly poignant.I loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: \"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...\"And at the end as I thought about McCandless's life, I thought that this passage from Thoreau was nowhere more suitable: \"Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\"",

                "Christopher McCandless lived a silly life and died a silly death. Here was a guy who gave his savings to Oxfam, left home without uttering a word to his family and who thought salvation lay in the wilderness. Too bad, then, that he ate the wrong type of plant and carked it.All the time we're told what complete bastards McCandless' parents are. They drove Christopher into the wild. But what was their crime? Apparently they argued some, even lied a little and their children were born out of wedlock. Okay, they're not the best parents in the world, but do they deserve the harsh treatment that their son dishes out \u0096 no letters, no postcards, no phone calls? Well, if you're a massive jerk and you're somehow unable to comprehend that human relationships are more complicated than a simple 'they're good' or 'they're bad', then you may be able to build a case for young Christopher, but if you have any depth of feeling in your soul, you may well think that McCandless punished his parents beyond anything that is reasonable. And also remember that he never contacted his beloved sister. She got the silent treatment as well. However, we have a scene where Christopher goes to call her, but instead he gives his quarter to an old man who is running out of change. What a great guy, we're asked to think. See how he lends a helping hand to strangers. But what about his poor sister, the person who loves him most in the world? This apparently is his one feeble attempt to reach out and tell her that he's okay.But no, Christopher is determined to live alone in the wilderness - to find himself. He wants to escape from a sick society where people treat each other poorly. Hell, his parents even have the nerve to offer to buy him a new car and pay for a Harvard education. Those phonies. Those shallow fakers who give him a home to live in and money to spend. How disgusting they are.Okay, so fair enough, the parents that we're presented with here are stiff, middle class dweebs who are more interested in appearances than anything of any substance, but what had me shaking my head was the assertion that Christopher's disappearance made them better people. Suddenly they're thoughtful and united and in tune with one another. Yes, that's what every strained marriage needs \u0096 their children to put them through a couple of years of hell.But what I find most objectionable is the romanticising of the wilderness. Is this the only way that anyone can find themselves, by opening their arms and standing on the edge of a mountain and by kayaking down a river? Isn't there any other way? Apparently not. We even get a scene where Christopher, briefly stranded in LA, looks into a restaurant populated by smarmy bastards and sees a yuppie version of himself. You see what he'd become if he stayed in the city? Hunting moose and talking to hippies is the only way to become a rounded individual.But the disaffection with society in this film is incredibly adolescent. In one scene, Christopher and a buddy of his just start impotently shouting 'society!' Yeah, society sucks and the wilderness is great. The wilderness never starved anyone, ate anyone or froze their balls off. In the eyes of every bear and moose is truth and beauty, and on the cold streets of civilisation is a steady flow of lies and deceit.However, at the end, Christopher maybe finally begins to understand that his quest is full of crap. He writes something along the lines that happiness is meaningless if you don't have someone to share it with. It took you all that time to figure that out? That human connections are what make life bearable? You could have found that out back home, sitting on your couch in your underpants, stuffing Cheetos down your throat.But of course, it's the journey that matters, isn't it? And what a tedious journey it is. Christopher meets hippies and quirky foreigners (who are good) and men with badges (who are bad). He helps people like a shaggy-haired Littlest Hobo and enjoys the milk of human kindness. Well, he enjoys the milk of human kindness as long as the people are poor. Everyone who has no money in this film is an insightful, kind-hearted, itinerant poet. Plus none of the hippies he meets are smelly, ugly, incoherent bastards who drown in their own drug-fuelled nonsense. No, they're inspiring people, who plaster their vehicles with outdated sentiments like 'freedom', 'peace' and 'love'.But it's notable that there's a moment when even a bear won't eat Christopher. Supposedly the bear turns his nose up at him because the kid stays calm or perhaps because he's so sick he doesn't smell that good. But I'd like to think that the bear turns his nose up because it's BS he can smell, and lots of it.However, as we all know from Timothy Treadwell, bears don't mind a bit of BS, but alas the film can't even come close to the genius of Grizzly Man, a film that shows you're no closer to finding reality in the wilderness than you are on the city streets. The problem here is that Penn is celebrating McCandless' folly instead of investigating it. Not for one moment are we asked to consider that this kid is perhaps a bit of an idiot. We're meant to find his journey inspiring and his plight tragic. But instead it's neither of those things. And at the end his death is elevated to grandiose status (it's shot like he's ascending to heaven, that he's communing with god). But in reality his death is what happens when a deluded moron tries to live in the wilderness without a map or enough food.",

                "Who Is Chris McCandless? A true supertramp? An obsessive, emotionally damaged egomaniac? Suicidal thrill-seeker? A Kerouac-like drifter addicted to the search for an ever-evasive truth? A high-functioning schizophrenic? The 21st century youth culture reincarnation of John Gault? Or just a kid going through a difficult time and looking for some distance to sort it all out? Sean Penn's pop-philosophical examination of this young man's voyage across America, to Alaska, and to the depths of his young soul will give you an interpretation at least. While it is not clear exactly whose interpretation we are seeing, it is very clear that Penn respects his subject and gave this film about as much thought and power as he could inject it with. And the film did remind me of something very true about the self-righteous naivet\u00e9 of youth.I am not concerned at all with the accuracy of the film, and, while it is tempting to compare this film to Werner Herzog's excellent but less fictionalized \"Grizzly Man\", the subjects are really too widely disparate; Herzog and Penn's perspective on humanity is too different to produce a meaningful comparison. The targets of this comparison, too big and too easy. But I will make one comment about the two films - Penn's film is much more or a tribute to its protagonist than Herzog's.I found Into the Wild to be a gripping, thoughtful film. The script was good, but sometimes a bit pretentious - occasionally crossing the line between character development and character worship. Penn's direction and cinematography are masterful. The acting - every member of the cast included - is absolutely excellent.Recommended - but not for light cheerful entertainment.",

Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great.",

                "I come away from this movie somewhat conflicted, not about the picture itself but of it's principal character, Christopher McCandless. I say that with some reservation as well, because when I was his age and fresh out of college, I spent a lot of time steeped in existentialist thought trying to figure out the meaning of life and how to conduct my own. In McCandless's case, there was also the family dysfunction at work, something that I never had to contend with growing up.At the heart of the movie, I don't have a lot of problem with Chris's philosophy of \"If you want something in life, reach out and grab it\". The paradox in that statement occurred exactly at the time he was saying those words to guitarist Tracy (Kristen Stewart) who fell hard for Chris at the traveler's camp. She was 'reaching out to grab it' and things weren't going to work out for her in quite the same way. So life has it's way of throwing those kinds of curveballs at you.No doubt some will find the message of uninhibited freedom and life without constraints to be an appealing one, but in the final analysis, doesn't the mere fact of existence require one to do the prudent thing? Chris McCandless's death was so unnecessary. Chances are, had he gone on to live say, a full five or ten years in the wild, he might have come to an entirely different conclusion about the meaning of his life and how to be a productive citizen of the world. His reading of Tolstoy offered a clue to an acceptable view of happiness - work which may be of some use, rest, nature, books and music. Loneliness didn't seem to be part of that equation.",

                "One of the best movies I've ever seen. Beautiful, deep, true, adventurous, sad, occasionally funny, real, at times very touching. Based on a real-life novel, it is written and directed by Sean Penn. I have always loved the movie work of Sean Penn. Congratulations and thank you to Mr. Penn on giving me a few hours of though-provoking delight. Can you say Oscar? This movie says it loud and clear! The story; Christopher McCandless, just graduated from college in the early 1990s, goes off on an adventure. He is smitten with books he reads\u0097Thoreau, London, Byron. He wants no money, so he gives his to needy causes or burns it. Chris is cocky, driven, industrious. He is traumatized by his parents' bad marriage. He tries to work through his anguish. He seems determined to destroy himself just to prove that he has different values than his parents. He is inconsiderate of his family and keeps them worried about his whereabouts and safety, as if a single reassuring phone call would ruin his rebellion. He fancies himself a philosopher, but acts the petulant child. It is a great credit to the film that we see these character flaws in our hero. Off on the road, he makes a number of foolish choices \u0096 and suffers from some of them. Other foolish choices, such as daring to kayak a rapid river, bring him joy. He meets a lot of people and almost all are kind to him. His interactions with people are intense, the kind you have when you are planning to run off and disappear while you are still a mysterious entity. He avoids getting too close to anyone.The movie is gorgeous. Mountains, plains, sky, rivers, animals. The acting is fantastic, totally believable. The actors are incredible and perfectly cast \u0096 Catherine Keener as an aging hippie vagabond, Vince Vaughn as a wacky farmer growing who knows what, William Hurt as Chris' potbellied suburbanite dad, Marcia Gay Harden as the type of mom who breeds children who wants to run off to the wilderness to escape from her. Emile Hirsch plays Chris, and does a great job of it. When an actual photo of the real Chris McCandless comes on screen, we see that Hirsch resembles him. Original songs by Eddie Vedder give the right feel \u0096 that of a well-to-do young white man heading out on a chosen adventure, getting gritty by choice. His goal is to get to Alaska, but on the way there, he hits many other states and Mexico, too.Chris is a clueless kid from the warm South. He plans to go to Alaska, yet only arrives with any needed equipment because kind folks force it upon him \u0096 a machete, warm clothes, rubber boots. He's highly educated and gets good grades, yet, early on his trip, ignores a big sign that warns of flash floods. That prepares us that we are going to wince many times at his low level of common sense, while at the same time reveling in his physical strength and willingness to press on. At one point, Chris passes through Los Angeles. He is dirty, hungry, tired, and goes to a downtown mission shelter. The other men there are also dirty, hungry, and tired, but not of their own choosing. It is not their adventure, it is their life. He realizes fast that he does not want to feel categorized with men who are in dire straits due to misfortune and not due to following their own adventure. The movie shows Chris as an honorable young man. I do not want to give away any of the plot, so I'll just say \u0096 the young man has principles and so does the movie.A few parts of the movie confused me. After Chris's college graduation, he meets h is parents at a restaurant. He brings with him a lovely young woman, obviously his date. Weirdly, it turns out that she is his sister! There is more confusion when Chris picks up work on a farm run by Wayne, the Vince Vaughn character. What are they growing or doing? What's up? There is an unintentionally funny scene where an old man tells Chris that he does not have time for adventures because he is too busy with leather. I thought the old guy was confessing being into whips and chaps. But no, he has a workshop where he tools leather. There were a couple spots where the editing distracted from the movie. I saw a preview; maybe it was a rough cut. There's a scene on the farm where a triple screen is used \u0096 like a cheesy commercial. Another scene, where Chris is eating an apple, is a series of jump cuts, which I really liked. It seemed an homage to French auteur filmmakers. But it ends with Chris mugging at the camera. With it, Sean Penn breaks the believability and acknowledges that yes, this is just us making a movie. There is another part where Chris is in a car with the older man who is dropping him off. As they pull up, there is an inexplicable cutaway shot of what looks to be the head of a cannon. Much of the movie is like a travel montage or music video involving mountains and sky. The scenes are so beautiful. I know people that have elements of Chris in them. And I think I've met all the characters he runs into out on the road.",

                "Sean Penn's 'Into the Wild' is a passionate and faithful evocation of Jon Krakauer's book about Chris McCandless. It's the troubling and complex story of a young idealist and seeker who was also a rebellious child and beloved brother who gave away his $24,000 savings to Oxfam after college, went off in an old Datsun and left his family behind, and disappeared for two years wandering the country, only to be found by hunters dead of poisoning and starvation in an abandoned bus in the wilds of Alaska.It's been said as a criticism of Penn's movie that it isn't as neutral about McCandless as Krakauers's book. It is true that Emile Hirsch as Chris, who called himself Alexander Supertramp on the road, is such a joyous and appealing character it's hard to focus on the arbitrariness and foolhardiness of the young man. Hirsch gives his all. He has shown his knack for playing bad good boys\u0097particularly in 'Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' and 'Lords of Dogtown'\u0097and for playing wild misfits\u0097in the little seen 'The Mudge Boy.' This is the first great role he's had, and he deserves it. His work is a wonderful melding of \"negative capability\" and generosity. It comes naturally to him to embody exuberance, boldness, and joy. If there was something off-putting or stern in the real-life McCandless, it's not very noticeable in Hirsch. But Hirsch's enthusiasm makes sense of the great adventure and self-discovery this story recounts. (Sadly, McCandless never seemed more ready to embrace life, and to overcome all his doubts about people and family, than right near his end.) All the faults McCandless had and mistakes he made made are there in the story as Penn tells it; if he has altered facts (and necessarily left some out), he hasn't done so to make the young man's plans seem clearer or his choices wiser, and the movie is replete with specific detail.'Into the Wild,' true, is itself a little on the wild and loud side, with its occasionally obtrusive Eddie Vedder soundtrack, it's insanely vivid characters\u0097like the young Danish couple on the banks of the Colorado, Vince Vaughan's intense, grinning grain farmer, Hal Holbrook's fabulously sad, shut-down old widower. There is another kind of overload in the occasional use of split screens. But it all unfolds very much as Jon Krakauer's book does, with interludes at the \"magic bus\" where Chris met his doom constantly intercut with episodes from his travels earlier during his two wander-years. And incredible episodes they are: roaming with a warm hippie couple; illegally and hair-raisingly running the Colorado rapids in a kayak; working in the big grain elevator and loving it; riding the rails and loving that too, till he's caught and beaten; escaping a flophouse in L.A.; staying with old Mr. Franz (Holbrook), learning from him how to engrave leather belts and persuading him to climb a mountain; and then off into the hostile snow country with a big back pack and sheer will. Many voiceovers from Chris's sister add more about the sibling relationship than was in the book; the family \"fearlessly\" cooperated in the film-making. McCandless's stern NASA honcho dad (William Hurt) and uptight mother (Marcia Gay Harden) are as unappealing as he saw them, but are not overdrawn\u0097or underrepresented. Among other things Sean Penn's film is a remarkable balancing act.It's obvious this story had to be made into a movie, and it's hard to imagine how anyone could have done it better than Penn and his fine cast. All Penn's directorial efforts have been heartfelt and earnest, but this of his films thus far is his greatest artistic success and has the widest appeal. Into the Wild is a good balance of the emotionally wrenching and the thought-provoking. It contains so many themes and poses so many questions\u0097about youth, about time, about responsibility. Chris isn't to be confused with Herzog's 'Grizzly Man'. He's aware of the danger of nature. It's just that he has the hubris of daring to approach it with too little knowledge and experience, knowing the risk, and taking it. And indeed he might have made it and gotten back out, but for two or three terrible mistakes. Nature is unforgiving.Chris McCandless was unforgiving too. But if he read the romantic Bible of his own life lived in those intense two years and lived to tell of them, the film suggests, he would have learned to love and forgive. He was bright, talented, passionate about life, a seeker or rare moral fervor who read and thought and recorded all that happened in those last days. His death was sadly premature. But there are signs\u0097they're clear in Krakauer's book\u0097that he made an impact on the world he inhabited and the people he met. Vince Vaughan's character shouts, \"You're one hell of a young man. You're one hell of a young man!\" He died terribly alone. But maybe the tree that falls in the forest is heard after all. \"Quant'e' bella giovanezza,\" goes an Italian renaissance verse, \"Che si fugge tuttavia.\" How beautiful is youth, which flees straightaway. McCandless' story embodies those lines.'Into the Wild' seems more moving and thought-provoking than any other recent film, and may be destined to become some kind of classic\u0097an 'Easy Rider', some have said, for our times. It's about society and nature, about family, about idealism and aloneness; most of all it's about the dangerous, heartbreakingly brief and beautiful romanticism of youth. In those two years, Chris McCandless lived a whole, remarkable, life. And Sean Penn has captured those two years for us.",

                "Sean Penn's \"Into The Wild\" is perhaps best viewed as being part of a recent wave of eco-themed films (\"Wall-E\", \"Avatar\", \"The Happening\", \"An Inconvenient Truth\", \"Grizzly Man\", \"Dreamland\", \"Day The Earth Stood Still\", \"Antichrist\", \"Day After Tomorrow\", \"Happy Feet\" etc). Most of these films urge their audiences to \"return to nature\", \"retreat to some pastoral existence\" or \"save the planet\" (without looking at the systemic or economic forces which completely undermine or neutralise such wants).Interestingly, aside from \"Antichrist\", \"Grizzly Man\" and \"Into The Wild\", nature in these films is always portrayed as being some kind of mystical, \"balanced\" system. While mega-studios, quite ironically, advise us to harmonize with nature, \"smaller\" directors (Penn, Herzog, Von Trier) seem to instead posit worlds in which nature is vile and base. Nature is still portrayed as being majestic and splendid, but is then associated with asphyxiation and choking, death and rot. The only harmony \u2013 as Werner Herzog once famously said \u2013 is that of overwhelming and collective murder. Murder, then, is the central theme of both \"Grizzly Man\" and \"Into The Wild\". Like Sydney Pollack's \"Jerremiah Johnson\", both films are about young men (Christopher McCandless in Penn's film, Timothy Treadwell in Herzog's) who cut themselves off from civilisation and venture off into the wilderness. Of course both Herzog and Penn initially romanticise their central characters' flights. They see beauty in this journey and a kind of crazy inner strength (McCandless rejects vapid materialism, 9 to 5 routines and sees the modern word as being a hindrance which atrophies humanity and conscience ). But both artists are also careful to counter this idealism with nature at its most violent. And so both films find their heroes \"leaving civilisation\", but only because they've first suffered a total, psychological collapse. They now disbelieve in their Master Signifiers, in their Symbolic Orders, and see civilisation itself as being representative of that which is arbitrary and chaotic. Both films then end with the deaths of their central characters, McCandless killed by a lowly poisonous berry, Treadwell killed by a mighty grizzly bear. This is not romanticism: the impetus for our adventures is something sad and pathetic, even if they're absolutely right. Their problem is that they've diagnosed civilisation but idealised Nature, a fatal failing; mankind's history is a history of battling the wild outdoors. Respect Nature. Approach with caution.And so both Treadwell and McCandless are portrayed as being disenchanted idealists who cut themselves off from a world they no longer feel apart of, no longer trust, no longer believe in. But while Penn romanticises Christopher's idealistic dream of \"entering the wilderness\", he is careful to counter this with nature at its most violent. Christopher hunts for food but recoils from maggots, Christopher attempts to cross a river, but nature's violent highways prove too powerful, Christopher forages for berries, but eats only poisonous weeds which ultimately kill him.The result is that Penn celebrates disenchantment and urges one to disconnect (mental breakdown, oft the precursor to wisdom), even as he warns that drifting too far is itself a form of suicide or self-destruction. Chris wants to cut himself off from mankind (the film opens with a quote from the Romantic Movement which advocates \"ostracizing oneself from humanity\"), but also learns that \"Happiness Is Real Only When Shared\" (the last dreams he has is of hugging his parents). And that's Penn's irony: it is the connections that Christopher makes with other people as he continues along on his journey which allowed him to survive in the wilderness for as long as he did. When towards the end of the film Christopher turns down an offer to live with an elderly man, he effectively gave up entirely on humanity. This total disconnection, this suicidal action, is ultimately what the film warns of.The kind of balance that the film longs for is thus similar to the teachings of Thoreau, who advocated finding a middle ground between rejecting and fully embracing the wilderness. The people Chris meets (and rejects) along his journey are thus in possession of the life he longs for.Elsewhere the film is about the enchantment of text and the romance of words. Krakauer wrote about Chris not only because Chris' journey was inspired by idealistic books (Chris takes literature rather than food with him) but because Chris was himself a writer and left behind numerous documents. What the film thus does is sets up a war between the word (fantasy) and the image (world). As each level of text is one step removed from reality, image eventually wins, the image of a berry and the failure to correctly read it being what ultimately kills Chris.Audiences typically view Chris as either a \"hero\" or a \"jerk\", but he's more a lost, fragile child. Having learnt that everything he knew about his parents and his own history was a lie, Chris began to distrust everything. Suddenly all truths were shattered. The only way for Christopher's mind to cope with this subjective destitution was to then enter a little fantasy world in which he's a \"noble adventurer\". As he loves meta-acting, Penn thus has actor Emile Hirsch play Christopher as a wounded guy playing the role of the very romantic hero he reads about in books.Elsewhere, like Kirk Douglas' \"Lonely Are The Brave\", Penn contrast modern technology with primitivism. He stresses the artificiality of the caravans and abandoned buses which Christopher relies on to survive, and counterpoints Christopher's physical death with a near spiritual shot of a modern passenger jet. The film does not condemn modern technology, it recognises it as a necessity. The film then ends with Christopher's body seemingly \"transcending\" into heaven. The film then rewinds, his body sucked into the ground, Penn's camera pulling back such that Christopher's corpse seems to be asphyxiated by Nature. 8.5/10 \u2013 Worth two viewings.",

                "There is a certain irony to the story from \"Into the Wild\", as Hollywood, the land of excess, does a film about a man who got rid of all his possessions in order to live simply off the land. It would be like me (at 250 pounds) writing a diet book! Now I am not attacking Sean Penn or the film or any of the ones who made the film...but in general I just cannot associate Hollywood with the life of Christopher McCandless!The story begins with Chris graduating from Emory University, a prestigious school in Georgia. Now you'd think he would be on the fast track to financial success...but instead he gives away nearly everything he has and heads into the wilderness to live a bit like a nomad. It seems Chris was tired of a life of acquiring things and wanted to live simply...and mostly alone. He also seemed to be running away from himself....or at least who he and his family were.\nUltimately his life would take him from the American Southwest all the way to the wilds of Alaska. This tale is based on a true story, as told by Chris' sister in the film.I think this is a movie where I enjoyed the style more than the story itself. I liked the simple style, the simple music and the mostly lesser-named stars in the picture. I also respect how much Emile Hirsch put himself out for the role...his weight loss throughout the movie was dramatic. As a trained therapist, however, I couldn't help but think the Chris would have benefited a lot from therapy before taking such a huge leap in his life. He was clearly, in an odd way, suicidal and I was concerned how the film seemed to romanticize this.\nOverall, an interesting but often unpleasant and overlong movie...worth seeing once but not a film I'd rush to recommend.",

                "I found something utterly fascinating in the true story of Christopher McCandless, venturing out into the \"wild\" of Alaska with basically nothing but a gun and some food, and eventually succumbing to the inevitable.I passed no judgment on him or his decisions when I read through the story, focusing more on the mystery of what drove him to a vagabond existence culminating in total hermitage from which he absolutely could not survive. The clich\u00e9 of \"the devil is in the details\" is one horribly true here, and tends to tear apart the story.In truth, McCandless essentially committed suicide. He refused all the necessary help to survive in the cold, did not even learn how to dry meat, and, had he had a map, could have easily walked back to civilization at almost any point in time.In fact, we can learn almost nothing from McCandless or his time spent in the wild, as his journal entries are as mindless and empty and almost completely devoid of any real content. They literally amount to things like \"Day 2: Fall through the ice day.\" \"Day 4: Magic bus day.\" \"Day 9: Weakness.\" \"Day 10: Snowed in.\" \"Day 68: Beaver Dam. Disaster.\" \"Day 107 (the last entry): Beautiful berries\"Going into the actual film itself, we get virtually none of this. Instead we are taken on a tediously long, droning journey that covers almost none of the survival aspects and just covers his wandering through the US in the years leading up to the event.Throughout this \"journey\" we're treated to overly dramatic musical montages waxing poetic on how \"society, man, society is just society, man\" ranting and railing with all the emptiness and incoherence of someone with basic understanding of almost everything, but knowledge of almost nothing.Life sure does sucks for a rich white kid who graduates from a prestigious university with nearly all A's, the movie tells us. How can you be happy with things like money and a job instead of living in the woods, hanging out with psychotically upbeat Danish tourists you meet after barely surviving a dangerous river paddling you jump in with 0 paddling experience, ignoring the guy who tells you you need to sign on with a professional because you could die. What does he know? Society, man. Screw society, man.The truth about the abuse he and his sister suffered from their parents wasn't revealed publicly by the time his movie was made (though she did disclose it off the record to the book author Jon Krakauer), so it's never made fully explicit here. But the whole theme of the movie is such that it doesn't matter, because it doesn't easily fit into the theme that \"society sucks and you can only be happy living in the woods\".The immense scale of the romanticization is insufferable. It becomes painfully pretentious almost immediately and it makes the protagonist thoroughly unlikeable; a vapid, empty vessel literally living the dream of the vapid spoiled white kid who worships nature and thinks modern society is a drag. The least I can say about this fictional version of McCandless is he is at least completely devoid of the self-righteous spite and meanness of a character like Holden Caulfield. He's not rubbing our faces in this pretentious message; the film itself is, and sometimes it seems as if he's just as much a victim as we are, having his adventure luridly fetishized as if he were an idol, and not someone who was way in over their head.I can't help but think of a similar story of someone who died in the Alaska wilderness, Carl McCunn in 1981. He went with almost 2 tons of food and supplies, multiple weapons, and actually left highly detailed journal entries telling a tragic story of a man who made a rather different mistake; He did not make it clear to the pilot who left him in the wilderness to return for him 5 months later. As 5 months slips into 6 months, you can clearly feel the pain in his entries as he realizes he is likely never coming back alive, and no one is likely to come looking for him. At one point, he is even spotted by a state trooper flying over in a plane, but laments in his journal that he apparently accidentally signaled to the trooper that he was okay and not in need of rescue. His final entry is a plea to God to forgive him and look over his family, then writing \"They say it doesn't hurt\" before taking his own life rather than freeze to death.There's nothing remotely like that in this film. The film barely lingers on Chris's experience of solitude in the wild, preferring to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on with his silly adventures, interspersed with upbeat montage after montage set to popular music.",

                "This is a really good movie, unfortunately I could not remove myself from the fact that the main character was a complete moron. First of all contrary to what people feel, \"dropping out of society\" is a lazy, b.s. way of rebelling against corporate society, and never achieves anything but a self fulfilled prophecy. Here is what native Alaskans felt about this fool in general. \"Krakauer's book made McCandless a heroic figure to many.Unlike Krakauer and many readers of his book, who have a largely sympathetic view of McCandless, some Alaskans have negative views of both McCandless and those who romanticize his fate. McCandless was unaware that a hand-operated tram crossed the river a quarter mile from the Stampede Trail, while a nearby shelter was stocked with emergency supplies, as described in Krakauer's book. However, the three nearby cabins were broken in and vandalized extensively at some point after mid-April, thus destroying food and first-aid supplies, as noted by Jon Krakauer. Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote: \"I am exposed continually to what I will call the 'McCandless Phenomenon.' People, nearly always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent ... When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament ... Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide.\" Judith Kleinfeld wrote in the Anchorage Daily News that \"many Alaskans react with rage to his stupidity. You'd have to be a complete idiot, they say, to die of starvation in summer 20 miles off the Park's Highway.\"[12] Thank you very much, but making a martyr out of a moron is just too much.",

Having graduated from Emory University the super spoiled typical rich kid rebels against what is expected of him by his parents. Like most of his type knowing full well he can always fall back on his parents wealth when it suits them to do so he then sets out on squandering his allowance after reportedly having donating his allowance to charity. The character playing his sister provides a narrative throughout the film providing a rational that his parents premarital experiences as well as their highly strained marriage as the reason for his escape into irresponsible living.This mainly fantasized account of Chris McCandless's last stage of life includes all these encounters that paint him as a much loved eccentric character idolized by young women, a grain farmer, welfare workers, burnt out hippies and an old man who wants to adopt him. He breaks ecological laws by rafting down the Colorado river without a permit to Mexico where he sweet talks his way back into the USA without ID papers. McCandless then finishes his little road trip adventure with a hunting trip to the Alaskan wilderness. Despite being fully equipped and armed the idiot McCandless manages to die of a combination of starvation, poisoning and over exposure. Sean Penn directs this silly film which will no doubt find fans amongst superficial young women and other well to do hippie types. I suspect these types of films inspire young people to take foolish paths in life that only the rich can afford to take and have seen this happen to friends of mine with similar disastrous consequences. I'm giving it one star because maybe it will inspire other idiots to perish in the wilderness. I was not keen on the wasteful shooting of Alaskan wildlife for McCandless's camping experiment.

                "Sean Penn did a good job bringing the film to life. However, I have so many issues with this film.The cinematography is beautiful, helped off course by the stunning landscapes. The dialogue is very poetic, and the performances were good. The extreme close-up photography, though, was a bit nauseating at times.The film can easily be seen as a celebration of life (albeit a bit extreme!), and to explore and experience the beauty of nature. Nowadays we tend to forget nature actually exists. As for Chris, he did some nonsensical things along the way. Often, he came across as extremely ungrateful, and even selfish. His argument for not needing (any) money was absurd.There were moments I felt the film was stagnating, and I wanted to push it along. 148 minutes is just way too long for a film like this to sit through, especially also since it is slow moving, and the non-linear narration. So, although it is a very well made film, - and there probably are a few lessons to be learnt here - it simply wasn't entertaining enough.Based on fact, I'm wondering whether I should actually feel sorry for real-life Chris McCandless, on who's adventures the film is based. He brought what happened to him upon himself. Pure self-indulgence! He didn't think his adventure through properly and didn't plan ahead, and certainly didn't do enough research - typical spoiled brat! Having given his ENTIRE savings to charity tells me he was never planning on returning, and that this was probably a suicide mission.After more than tow hours and an ending I somehow predicted, I was really glad when it ended.",

                "When Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduated from college, he had one goal in life - to finally break away from his unhappy family and the constraints of society in general and live off the land in Alaska. The episodic film flashes back and forth between Chris' adventures in Alaska and the months leading up to it, focusing on the people who befriended him, including an aging hippie couple and a lonely, old man (well-played by the venerable Hal Holbrook).Based on a true story and narrated with many of Chris' journal entries, the film is an emotional roller coaster; I was torn between admiring his youthful idealism and courage and hating him for the pain he inflicted on his family. The movie feels much like a documentary as it follows Chris hitchhiking and working his way across the country and then surviving, at first, quite well in Alaska.Emile Hirsch is well-cast as Chris and makes you care about him right from the start. He did all of his demanding stunts himself and even lost 40 pounds to play the ailing Chris. It is a very touching story. Amid the splendor of the wilderness but ultimately alone, Chris finally understood that happiness is only real when it is shared. Highly recommended.",

                "I've never seen a movie quite like this one, not an American movie at any rate. The one that comes closest, maybe, is \"Easy Rider,\" but that one was full of plot points and ambition, raggedy though they turned out. \"Into the Wild\" is more like an assemblage of episodes from a self-made movie, put together with the help of some family friends who happen to be professional actors.Emile Hirsch is the non-fictional Chris McCandless who gives away everything he owns, takes to the road, and winds up owning nothing in the Alaskan wilderness, not even the opportunity to savor the emotional fulfillment of being completely and utterly alone.Hirsch isn't bad either. He is transformed from chubby and cheerful at the start to thin and desperate by the end. I would guess the film sticks pretty closely to its origins, which I think I remember reading in The New Yorker years ago.The narration is based on Chris's sister's memories and on Chris's own journal but narrations can be misleading or sometimes plain wrong. It seems to be all the fault of McCandless's bickering parents. It was they who drove him to these peregrinations. Well -- that's kind of an easy way out. It provides a satisfying explanation for a story that is likely to be otherwise unexplainable, at least until we know more about neurology. It's always easy to find a trigger for behavior in our past experiences. Psychoanalysis rode that horse for generations. In reality I suspect that strangeness in people is partly a given at birth, and the explanations are post hoc and fitted to the cultural climate. It's tough enough being the parent of an odd child without being blamed for every odd thing he does.Where was I? I think I started out for the Sea of Cortez and found myself, like Chris, in the North Woods.The photography is sometimes stunning, often appealing, and sometimes as idiosyncratic as Ray Bolger's dance in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Step motion, slow motion, negative shots, all are employed but not, thank God, to the point of nausea. The whole film is leisurely, moving back and forth from Chris's encounters at home and on the road, to the Magic Bus he lives in at the top of the world.Good actors. Nobody in the movie flubs it. Catherine Keener and William Hurt are exceptional performers but they have little to do on screen. Hurt does get a chance to register some convincing abject anguish at the end. Hal Holbrook, now an older man, has never been quite as good as he is here. A home run for Holbrook.Does the movie have a point? Well, it certainly tries to impose one on the narrative, something along the lines of spiritual fulfillment is worth any price, even life itself. Hirsch dies with an open smile on his face, gazing at opalescent clouds. (If I remember correctly, the real Chris assumed his absence would be noticed and was waiting for an expected helicopter rescue.) The fuzzy points I would take away don't include our need for others in any but a mechanical sense. (We need others to make our shoes and guns.) There have been successful hermits before. I certainly wouldn't conclude from this story that nature is cruel because it isn't. It's just indifferent. What are we, after all, except a widespread large mammal that happens to call itself Homo sapiens?",

                "I agree with many others who have said that the main character makes some bad decisions (And you haven't?), and I agree that the film's story is far from the greatest story that has ever been made into a film. However, the story here is an important one that has a lot to say about being human. The story itself is certainly not at all an easy one to tell through the cinematic medium. Nonetheless, I really do think Sean Penn has captured this story nearly as well as it possibly could have been told on film, and that in itself is a stunning accomplishment. This story is so real, so human, that it reaches out and has obviously grabbed a ton of peoples hearts, including mine. The scenes themselves give off a very authentic feeling, even where some parts are somewhat rushed through for the betterment of the whole story, it ends up working well in full scope. Many of the scenes are extremely intimate, including the scene where Hirsch looks directly into the camera to increase this very aspect I feel. I know a lot of people have criticized this part, and I agree in most films it would have no place whatsoever, but here it is a very daring and effective decision by Penn in my opinion. Much of the film displays a vast amount of scenic beauty, and the scenes at slab city are nothing short of 'classic'.To me, the important thing to take from the film is not why Chris decided to leave his parents and society. Nor do I think anyone can in their right mind criticize this decision he made. That is pointless. The fact is that it was his choice, whatever his accumulative reasons may have been is beside the point. The value here is in what he learns from the experience, and the incredible way in which he and Sean Penn have now shared that message with the rest of the world.Eddie Vedders music was obviously the perfect choice for this film, as it sways with emotional depth and helps to carry the films authentic feel. There are many great acting performances here as well, none better than Catherine Keener's brilliant delivery of grace and genuine heart.The story here ventures into the territory that drives all human experience. The search for authentic heart that all people, knowingly or not search for.The heart searches for heart, only to find itself treading in a sea of broken hearts, all cut from the same Divine Cloth.

                "Sean Penn's Into the Wild is beautiful, staggering, thoughtful, a labor of love made by a filmmaker with real passion for the story he set out to tell. Like a Terrence Malick picture, Into the Wild transcends any conception such as \"if you only see one film this year\" and goes beyond the very notion of \"Oscar-worthy\". If one really has to say something on the subject, then Into the Wild should have shared the Best Picture award with No Country for Old Men, but that kind of thinking is besides the point because Penn's masterpiece is more than a movie, or a work of art for that matter: it's a life experience.A rebel at heart, Penn clearly identifies, at least on a few levels, with the film's unconventional protagonist, a bright young boy named Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), whose astounding true story was first recounted in Jon Krakauer's book which gives the picture its title. Christopher had it all: loving parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister (Jena Malone), excellent grades and a most promising future. Then, one fine day the 20-year old college graduate decided that wasn't really what he wanted, took his law school fund and disappeared, setting out for a journey to the heart of America. \"I'm going into the wild\" the self-renamed Alex Supertramp wrote in his journal, and though he occasionally ran into people (Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and others) he would connect with in a deeper way, that's where he really belonged: away from civilization, just him, his elementary tools and the pure, untarnished nature surrounding him.Christopher's journey, which is carried out with just the basic resources one needs to survive (no cell phone or other gadgets), is a modern odyssey of sorts, a quest for something that was lost forever and won't be found in the near future. In a world like ours, where technology rules all, a choice like Christopher's would be met with disbelief and probably derision. That only heightens the intensity of the character's message, which is also what the director aims to tell us: we need to rediscover ourselves before it's too late. It doesn't matter whether we are young or old, as the protagonist touchingly teaches an elderly man (Hal Holbrook, the only cast-member to be nominated for an Oscar), the important thing is we give it a serious try.To simply call this a film isn't enough: in one of the most amazing combinations of efforts in the history of movie-making, the story, Penn's soulful direction, Hirsch's painfully real performance (will he ever be this good again?) and Eddie Vedder's elegiac songs (an essential soundtrack for any true film-lover) merge into something that's almost too powerful to describe in words: you have to see it to believe it.Into the Wild isn't an \"easy\" film: it will leave you very affected, possibly devastated, but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing a genuine masterwork. It will ignite real thoughts about life instead of the phony reflections so many \"issue movies\" try to induce. It will hit the gut, the heart and the mind in equal measure, and once the initial wave of emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded. Into the Wild does this because it isn't merely a motion picture: it is art, life, freedom and nature, all together in a mesmerizing piece of visual poetry.",

All you need to know is that the main character dies. From his own stupidity. From his own stubourness. And I felt absolutely nothing for him. Worse than that, I was happy that the arrogant, selfish little prick got exactly what he deserved. Inside I laughed a little and I am sure that is not what the director was going for.He put his family through hell for nothing other than selfishness. There is an attempt to blame this/justify it on his parents behaviour - hey Sherlock, parents are not perfect. And yours seemed pretty good, they provided for you, gave you a good home and brought you up to the extent that you had the whole world in the palm of your hand. But you threw it away because you were a grade A douche.What makes me really angry and confused is that this piece of crap is so unlikeable and the choices he made so stupid but Penn has crafted a film that would have you believe he is a hero. There is no objectivity in this at all - he was a brave young soul for doing what he did.

After their drought-ridden farm is seized by the bank, the family -- led by just-paroled son Tom -- loads up a truck and heads West. On the road, beset by hardships, the Joads meet dozens of other families making the same trek and holding onto the same dream. Once in California, however, the Joads soon realize that the promised land isn&#39;t quite what they hoped.",
            "The story of the Joad family is told, they, poor Oklahoma sharecroppers, who, like all others in their situation, are pushed off the land by the wealthy landowners, many large corporations, during the Great Depression, and, as a result, they, again like many others in their situation, making the decision for the dozen or so of the family members, with another one on the way, to migrate to what is seen as the land of opportunity, California, where jobs, specifically as fruit pickers, are purported to be plentiful. Not only because of the jalopy of a truck they could afford to buy to make the trek and their remaining limited funds which they calculate should just be enough to get them to California where they will once again start to earn money, their trip is not without incident from unforeseen circumstances. Arriving in California, they discover that the land of opportunity is not all it was advertised to be, with they and all others like them facing different challenges to survive, where, if there are jobs to be had, they are more often than not for wages on which a family cannot survive, and with security on site with guns and clubs to control labor unrest. Often, they will have to make some difficult decisions on whether to accept work in unacceptable conditions in even attempting to survive, or hold out, like some others are doing, but who are considered &quot;agitators&quot; who the owners will do anything to eliminate, for good if need be. While Ma Joad believes that the family unit is the most important thing that has always gotten them through the bad times, oldest son Tom Joad may have the most holistically consequential decisions as the one on parole, he just released from prison after four years of a seven year sentence for killing a man in a bar brawl.",

Money is tight; they have trouble affording 15 cents for a loaf of bread. They are warned that there is little work in California. Grandma () dies just before the family reaches the California border.\nThey arrive at an itinerate camp populated with hungry children. A man and sheriff come to the camp promising work but won't say how much they will be paid. A local man at the camp warns the others and the sheriff wants to arrest the man. The man runs away and the sheriff shoots at him, killing a bystander. Tom knocks out the sheriff and flees.\nThe family leaves the camp and arrives at a farm that needs workers. Tom is wary. The farm is surrounding by a barbed-wire fence with plenty of armed guards. The family settles in a shack and picks peaches for five cents a box, earning barely enough to feed the family. After dinner, Tom takes a walk and encounters Casy in a camp just outside the farm. Casy is helping to lead a labor strike against the farm. Thugs from the farm kill Casy and Tom kills one of the attackers. Tom is hit in the face with a club, leaving a big gash.\nThe family loads up the truck again, hiding Tom under a mattress.

                "John Ford's film of John Steinbeck's novel has deservedly a classic film mirroring the views of both men and the times the book was written and filmed. Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.For most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture, the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice, a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.This is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere, like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs. America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review. Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they're treated like less than dirt, the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they're treated like humans. As it turns out, the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I'll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.Given some of the problems of the American economy today, The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn't really all that much a relic of our past. It's both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.",

                "In rural Oklahoma, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is walking and hitchhiking home from prison, after a stay of four years. After taking a knife at a dance, Tom hit the attacker with a pan, killing him. Nevermind that it was self-defense, Tom still gets sent to prison. He hasn't heard from his parents, Ma (Jane Darwell) or Pa because they aren't the \"writing types\". A fierce dust storm makes Tom's final few steps treacherous. Arriving back at their small cabin, where his family are sharecroppers, Tom and his passing friend, Casy (John Carradine) are startled to find no one at home. A shell-shocked neighbor informs the other two that the family has been kicked off their land in foreclosure. They are nearby at Uncle John's house, where his family is about to suffer the same fate. Its the Depression and the Dust Bowl has ruined the land, taking off the top soil; no one can grow crops. When Tom catches up with his Ma and company, they are overjoyed to see him, for their plans are to pack a truck and move to California, where handbills show pickers are needed. Grandpa doesn't want to leave the only home he has ever known, so they drug him with medicine and haul him along. Now on the Mother Road, route 66, the journey is difficult; the truck breaks down frequently, no one wants them to stay long anywhere they rest, and Grandpa dies of a stroke. Will California really be the Golden, Promised Land? NOT ON YOUR LIFE! This heartbreaking adaptation of Steinbeck's classic is a must-see for the whole wide world. This family of hard-working folks has one calamity after another, just trying to earn an honest and living wage. Those who lived in the Dust Bowl part of the country were hit especially hard, as the soil had been overworked and winds took the topsoil off, creating damaging storms to crops, humans, and animals. No better were the \"lies\" of the handbills, advertisements that migrants were needed in California, where over 300,000 poor helpless folks showed up for very few jobs.

                "The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who are run off of their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. I think that one of the most striking elements of this movie is the black and white cinematography. Obviously, there wasn't a lot of variation on this particular subject in 1940, but especially today, the lack of color enhances the feelings of poverty and desperation and emptiness due to the family's loss of their home. In this way, because it would not be nearly as noticeable in 1940 as it is today, this time-enhanced effect of the black and white film stock has allowed for the film's impact to actually grow with time. Henry Fonda plays the part of Tom Joad, a young member of the family who is released from prison at the beginning of the film, only to find that his family has been driven from their home and is staying at his uncle's house until they can figure out what to do about their sudden homelessness. It is by pure coincidence that Tom was released early on good behavior, otherwise he may very well never have seen his family again. He finds them in a state of near desperation, as they begin more and more to realize the predicament that they are in. Their trek across half of the country, on their way to California to assume jobs that they've heard about, provides for a substantial portion of the plot and is extremely well-structured.\nThe family encounters every hardship imaginable on this journey, from family members dying to their struggle to feed themselves to their rickety old truck constantly breaking down. They run into disillusioned people who claim that they've been to California and there are really no jobs there, at least not nearly as many as there are people going to look for them. They are periodically and derogatorily referred to as `Okies,' a term which places them in a broad category of poor folks driven from there homes in middle America who are traveling to the coast to get jobs that aren't there. There is so much doubt and hardship presented that it is never really certain whether they really will find jobs. The audience is never able to assume a happy ending, because there is so much contrary foreshadowing throughout the film. The struggles do not abate once the family reaches California and takes up shaky residence in residential areas that would be more accurately referred to as shanty towns, and the rest of the film is dominated by the family's efforts to survive in a new and unfamiliar place, while working for wages that are barely sufficient to prevent starvation. Ma Joad spends the majority of the film stressing the importance of keeping the family together, seeing it as the only thing that they really had left, but this is eventually set aside in favor of each member of the family not only surviving but also flourishing, which provides for one of the many powerful messages that the film delivers. The Grapes of Wrath is not exactly an edge of your seat film, but it is a shockingly realistic portrayal of the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. The performances are flawless, and the experience is not only powerful and moving but also educational. It's no secret that most people do not watch movies to learn, but there comes a point, at least once in a great while, when a person should watch a film that requires a little mental thought processing, and in such cases, The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent choice.",

                "It's difficult on a first viewing of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" not to be somewhat disappointed with it. So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the \"gee whizz\" style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out (like its final image, for example), but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad--never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad--she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland, who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed, much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images, and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.Grade: A",

                "During most of the decade of the 30s, the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty: the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel, \"The Grapes of Wrath\", a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.In \"The Grapes of Wrath\", Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in Oklahoma. When he arrives, he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is Jim Casy (John Carradine), the former preacher of his community. Together they decide to go to the house of Tom's uncle John (Frank Darien) looking for the Joads, and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. The Joads explain Tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm, and that they are moving to California looking for work and a better life. While he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole, Tom decides to join his family and convinces Jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to California. However, things won't be as easy as they thought they would.Adapted to the screen by Nunnally Johnson, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" takes on the spirit of John Steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh, crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the Dust Bowl. Despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel (changes were done due to censorship), the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had, and it could be said that Johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. While this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is, with all their vices and virtues. It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.In 1939, John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed \"Stagecoach\", \"Young Mr. Lincoln\" and \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" in less than 12 months. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography, Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism, Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's \"Young Mr. Lincoln\", one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie: Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy, Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine, Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as Ma Joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.As written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However, Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly, producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.With a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences, John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 10/10",

                "The Grapes of Wrath was impressively released less than a year following the release of the novel and yet within this short timeframe director John Ford crafted one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. A number of John Ford's movies have that foreign film feel - a feeling of very raw, lifelike emotion. The Grapes of Warth itself is one of the most emotionally draining films of all time with one scene after another drawing up such feelings of pity; everything is rough, dirty nor is there makeup on any of the actors. Just take the scene in which the depression-ridden Joad family on their way to California attempt to buy bread from a dinner (a scene which really puts the value of money in perspective) - The emotion is one part humility and the other part pathetic.Yokels, rednecks, hillbillies - everyone's favourite punching bag. The Grapes of Wrath doesn't look down America's uneducated, rural white folk nor presents them as a caricature but that still doesn't change the fact that none of the Joad clan are the sharpest tools in the shed nor don't understand how the outside world works. Just as we are introduced to the family the youngest daughter Rosasharn is pregnant and married when still a teen while the family is dirt poor and huge as it is.Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad may be the pinnacle of his acting career. His stone face alongside the laid-back manner in which he walked and talked is mesmerising yet Joad is not someone I would fancy being in the vicinity off. Fonda's performance has a sinister edge to it and a sense of barely restrained violence. His proclamation to the truck driver near the beginning of the film when telling him the reason he was in prison, a simple uttering of \"homicide\" could come straight out of a horror movie. Jane Darwell on the other hand as Ma Joad is the other great scene stealer with her hauntingly sombre, tour-de-force performance as a character with one ultimate aim - keeping the fambly together.The amazing landscape shots, use of German expressionism and high contrast lighting give way for such unforgettable images from a car light driving along the horizon to silhouettes walking across a hill, thanks to cinematographer Gregg Toland. Take the scene at the campsite in which the characters discuss their present situation; it's so dreamlike with the odd, unnatural angles, it couldn't be more mesmerising. I also recommend watching the South Park episode Over Logging which parodies this scene (and the movie as a whole), right down to the black & white cinematography.Once the Joads arrive at the Farmworkers' Wheat Patch run by the Department of Agriculture it is a temporary relief to see something good happen to the family, after all, they have been through. When The Grapes of Wrath was released in 1940, the US Secretary of Agriculture was Henry A. Wallace, whom that same year was running for Vice President with Franklin D. Roosevelt; a message of support for FDR and the New Deal no doubt? At the government camp they are greeted by a seemingly genuine, honest man who looks like FDR and tells them they have washtubs with running water; a world away from the corporate run camps the Joads took residence earlier in the film - all sounds too good to be true? The government is the solution to the Joad's problems (temporally at least as they end up leaving at a later point), nor at any point in the film do we see any charitable organisations out to help the poor. It's fairly obvious that The Grapes of Wrath doesn't exactly lean to the right of politics; evil bankers running people off their land, corrupt police, capitalists treating people like dogs, total collapse of the free market, socialist camp run by the government is only decent place to be in which cops are not allowed to lines of dialogue such as \"people are going to win rich, people are going to die\". - A world of oppressor and the oppressed if there ever existed one. Regardless of one's politics, I still contend The Grapes of Wrath to be one of the most emotionally draining films in all of cinema.",

                "This classic adaptation of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" features a fine cast as well as a skillful production headed by director John Ford. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are well-remembered for their roles, which are among the defining roles in their careers. The only limitations that it has come from the original novel, with its heartfelt but sometimes contrived story.Besides Fonda and Darwell, the supporting cast features plenty of good supporting players, including Charley Grapewin and John Carradine. All of them make their characters come alive believably. They also fit together well and complement one another's performances, which accentuates the themes involved in the struggles of the Joad family.For all that the Steinbeck novel is so revered, and for all that his story is an often compelling depiction of its characters, with whom many in the era could identify, it would have been better if it had not been so heavy-handed. Even given that the times were bad, more balance in the characters outside of the family, and in the Joads' experiences, would have made it an even better story. Certainly, this is barely even noticeable when compared with the stories in many present-day movies and novels, which often dispense with any attempts at plausibility.And that does not stop this adaptation from being a worthwhile and often moving film.

I will tell a short version of my personal life to let you know how it affected me from my own experience of growing up in the ThirtiesI think their must have been more then one car because ours was full of stuff in the back seat, clear up almost to the roof. Frankie, Bill and me (my brothers) all was on top of the stuff in the back seat, had to stay lying down was not enough room to set up. What I remember most about the trip was it was awful hot when we went through Arizona and we had not much water, the water we had was in a canvas bag, hooked to the front bumper to help keep it cool. We did not get much because dad was saving it for the car when the car got to hot. Mom told us to suck on pebbles, and we did. It was a bad time every where. No jobs or anyway to make any money. We were going to California because their was suppose to be some picking work their, after we got to California we saw miles of potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high, they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was a white powder to keep people from taking them to eat.We found a place to pick plums that they used to make prunes and we lived in a Quonset hut made of corrugated metal setting on a concrete slab. The public toilets were near were we stayed, Joe and his wife (Family friends)had their own Hut\u0085this was the time that dad & Joe would sell tickets for people to watch them box each other in a ring at the recreation hall on the property. Also they joined a baseball team and played baseball, dad played left field. We got to watch them play for free.Seems like Frankie and I played together a lot don't think Bill did because he was still a baby his self, Doris and Dorothy (my sisters) was still crawling so Bill could not have been very old at that time. Frank & I would go pick up plums off the ground and we would bring them home, Doris and Dorothy would set in the box and eat them. You can guess what they would look like when mom and dad got home, their was no air condition back then so they would take a hose and squirt water on the tin Quonset hut to try and cool it off some, I know when we went west we looked like those grapes of wrath folks in the movie.That area was the first time I ever saw a frog walk, it was to hot for them to hop, when they tried to hop their bellies would touch the ground ( gravel) and would burn them, any way that's what we thought at that time. I saw the movie of Grapes of wrath a long time ago, and I remember it so well, I cried most of the time it was on because it reminded me of the hard time we all had back then, I was born in Oklahoma and it was just a terrible time in the late thirties I would love to see the movie again, its to me a history of my family, I am 71 1/2 years old now and still remember it very clearly.Gene McDaniel",

                "I'm will be there\u2014to review John Steinbeck and his great American novel, The Grapes of Wrath, about the westward migration of people during the dust bowl in the Depression of the 1930's. It was a huge hit in 1940, and soon it was turn into a movie directed by John Ford. The film stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joads, the incredible Jane Darwell as his mother. The film stands today as one of the finest examples of sensitive American cinema. It is an incredible combination of gut-wrenching scenes threaded through feel-good scenes that make you laugh and then sob. The movie is about The Joads family. They were destitute by faceless, corporative banks that seized their lands just when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) got out of prison. Forced out of their farm, the Joads are heading from the dust towns of Oklahoma to California for hope of a job. As aggressively coaxing is needed to acquire Grandpa Joad (Charley Grapewin) from leaving his abode, while the family meek existence is depended on the nurturing of Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who's strong upbringing sturdily holds them together. When the family arrives upon destination, they harbor terrible living conditions and given low wages in the migrant-worker camps. Hot tempered Tom Joad eventually collides with the wrong side of the law, as he is cornered to leave his family behind. A documented-style production in which seasoned pioneer John Ford received an Academy Award for his appraised directing. The Joads suffers much, and struggle in times of adversity. The visuals of the film, was outstanding. The desolation of the land and the desperation of the people were depicted very well. It does have an uplifting message despite its gloom. A black and white cinematography that would inspire Ansel Adams. Tom Joad's speech is very powerful, and makes you appreciate every meal you have. The idea of the interpretation of the film is that despite being in hard times, the Joads gave to others. Letting others stay with them, helping out others, giving away their food. The faults of the film are these\u0085 it's really heavy, slow tempo, long, and the Okie accent and dialect is hard to understand. Some harsh language in the book that wouldn't have been allowed in mainstream movies of that time is left out from the movie. The production codes did not allow for the shocking scene of a woman breast feeding a starving man that ends the book. In the book more detail is given about Tom Joad's older brother Noah. In the movie he's hardly featured at all, and in fact completely disappears from the latter part of the film with no explanation given as to where he went. The big difference between the movie and the novel is that the movie goes uphill while the novel goes entirely downhill. This makes all the difference. The uphill fashion of the film version fails to provide closure. For example, it lacks the powerful ending of the book, which I will not spoil. Anyways, this film and book should be read and view in EVERY school to show how lucky we are today and don't appreciated it with our many luxuries our money buys today. It doesn't belong 2 a particular era or country. It's the story of the struggles of humanity.",

John Ford, with this nifty little film, made the greatest argument for populist/socialist politics in cinematic history. This movie understands the Depression and the Dust Bowl and the poor and the hungry and the starving and all those people that the sign at Ellis Island (or is it at the Statue of Liberty?) says that we'll take on and help. It understands those people better than anyone or anything else I know. Steinbeck's novel helps this movie get to where it needs to be, but, let's be honest, the Grapes of Wrath is all John Ford. The sweeping vistas, the excellent editing and pacing, and the acting are of the highest caliber, as befits a John Ford film. I'm amazed every time I see this movie just how moving it is without straying into trite sentimentality. Tom Joad's speech at the end always makes me cry--his chilly delivery of the word homicide at the beginning continues to give me a prickly spine. Fonda was a great actor, and he is certainly at the top of his game here. Without him, interestingly, the film would have probably floundered. No one else could have possibly played Tom Joad; no one would have that charm and charisma and, most importantly, that voice. The rest of the cast is amazing, don't misunderstand, but Henry Fonda is Henry Fonda--an actor unto himself. There is no one like him and never will there be; he is the single most watchable actor of all time. And this isn't even my favorite John Ford movie! Nevertheless, it's a great film with a great message. Call me a pinko (it's been done before), but what's superb about this movie is its humanism. Yeah, the ideology promotes a type of socialism (ahem, I mean, let's not forget that that is basically what the New Deal was and if you think that system was a bad idea, then fine), but, really, the movie is about caring for people who don't have the resources to care for themselves. Grapes of Wrath is not a scathing indictment of anyone; it's a simple portrait of a family's struggles to overcome the Depression. It's uplifting and shows a real feeling for the downtrodden, and that's more than you can say about most American films that intend to deal with the poor and hungry.",

They had gratuitous overacting, fake \"Hollywood\" dialogue, and just general over dramatization. Since these films are typically over-dramatized in this way, their attempts at having a deeper or meaning or some sort of a message are ruined. But not all classic Hollywood films fall into this abyss of clich\u00e9s. And the ones that don't are still remembered and cherished to this very day, films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, or Modern Times, or 12 Angry Men, faced serious social issues at the time and succeeded. Films like these are unforgettable and in many ways life changing, and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath is one of these precious films.As I'm sure you all already know Grapes of Wrath is an adaptation of the John Steinbeck Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, that was published only a year before the film was first released. The novel is one of the greatest of the 20th Century, and I highly recommend that you should check it out. The film and the novel are both about Tom Joad, (played by Henry Fonda, who collaborated with John Ford several times.) who returns to his family's home in Oklahoma after spending 4 years in prison, but unfortunately by the time Tom Joad makes it out of prison, the country has fallen into the Great Depression. And the Joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers, so of course the bank repossessed there home and land, and the Joad family are forced to head west to California to look for work. But as they get closer and closer to California things begin to seem hopeless as they learn the truth about what is going on out in the west. If I were to choose one word to describe The Grapes of Wrath it would be haunting, so many scenes and lines of dialogue send shivers down your spine and make tears grow in the back of your eyes. I won't spoil any of these fantastic moments, but dear god the combination of John Steinbeck's masterful writing and the actors's somber performances combine to make these scenes and lines of dialogues absolutely devastating, you will be thinking about them for weeks after you watch the film. The cinematography (done by the legendary Gregg Toland, who also was the cinematographer for Citizen Kane.) is also outstanding. Shots of the deserted houses in Oklahoma, the wide open road on highway 66, and the overcrowded filthy slums of California, all give The Grapes of Wrath a bleak depressing atmosphere. Every single actor in the film gives it his/her all, Jane Darwell won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Ma Joad, and Henry Fonda was nominated for best leading actor. And while these two performances are just perfect, every single roll in the film no matter how small is also perfect. (well, except for some minor child-actor roles.) John Ford is an excellent actor director though, so this should come as no surprise. John Ford also won the Oscar for best director, this was his second Oscar (his first was for The Informer.) and it is well deserved, each scene is meticulously crafted to dig real deep into the audiences emotions and not in a way that feels cheap by exploiting the audience or something. No instead of going for cheap shallow emotions the way an Oscar-bait movie would, Grapes of Wrath instead has characters that don't even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles, there is no cheap manipulation in this film. It is 100% genuine.John Ford was a strange person for 20th century fox to pick to direct The Grapes of Wrath, because he was politically conservative and the book/film supported several liberal political ideas like strikes and unions. But John Ford was definitely the right choice. (see what I did there.) Grapes of Wrath was one of the few American films that was allowed to be released in the Soviet Union,it was only allowed because it supported pro-communist ideas. But it eventually had to be pulled from The Soviet Union when Soviet audiences saw that even dirt-poor begging Americans could still afford cars. In 1989 The Grapes of Wrath was one of the first 25 films to be added to the national film registry, alongside films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Casablanca. And it deserves its spot there, Grapes of Wrath has become the definitive Great Depression film, and should be viewed by everyone.9.5/10",

                "They say that you should wait 20 or 30 years before attempting to capture an historical event on film.  That is why it was remarkable that Oliver Stone was able to capture the \"feel\" of Viet Nam (in \"Platoon\") so soon (13 years) after America's withdrawal.  Usually, an honest perspective takes more time to develop.But, when you consider that John Steinbeck and John Ford needed less than ten years to bring the 1932 \"dust bowl\" to life, you really have to admire their magnificent achievement.    Of course, in 1940, Ford could not film much of the graphic squalor described in the novel.  For example, the film cannot show a starving hobo suckling at the breast of a young Rose of Sharon, who has milk to spare following the death of her baby.  But, far from degradation, Rose of Sharon's gesture is a reflection of the goodness that resides within her, and that quality is well illustrated in the character development seen on the screen.  Tom Joad may be an ex-con, but he is a good man.\nOne of the commentaries (below) uses this film to rant about the exploitation in today's society.  That completely misses the point.  Ford, who was as conservative as anyone in Hollywood, even more conservative than John Wayne, used this movie to show that Man can triumph, despite the natural and human barriers that are put in his way.   \nThis is ultimately a movie about hope and the human spirit.",

                "Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad captures perfectly the humanity and compassion of the Steinbeck character, an ex-con who breaks his parole conditions by joining his family in their epic journey across the southern US to a \"better life\" in California.This is not the usual Hollywood fare. Tragedy and betrayal beset the Joad family from the outset. But it is nonetheless an uplifting movie. Spirit, compassion and tenderness mark them out. Fonda's role is particularly understated, and we see, as in Steinbeck's masterly epic, the maternally robust figure of Ma holding the family together.The performances all round are wonderful, and Ford's direction and sense of space under the big sky of the Midwest is breathtaking.This film is now largely a testament to the time in which it was set, but like the war movies that were soon to follow, a story that needed telling lest we forget.",

                "The movie itself is generally recognized as about as good (or great) as you can get, especially considering that it was shot in 33 days. But it often gets nailed for two scenes, one absent from the film, the other changed drastically. No Rosasharn is not seen in the film nursing the dying old man from her swollen breast. If the scene had been shot in 1939 (or even suggested), the movie would never have been released. The second problem often pointed out is that the ending is too upbeat, what with Ma Joad's carrying on about how men live their lives in jerks while women flow along like Anna Livia Plurabelle, and \"we're the people that live.\" That last scene was written by Zanuck and was almost essential to a successful film in the late 1930s. Of course tragedies had been filmed for years, but ordinarily the tragic hero or heroine had earned his or her fate. Both audiences and authorities would have waxed wroth seeing an honest close-knit family crushed by an American economy that was totally inimical to their welfare. We need to look at art in the context of its time.From the Marxist perspective that Steinbeck used in writing the novel, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is the protagonist but the two most important characters are Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) and Casey the Preacher (John Carradine). Ma represents what Marx called \"false consciousness,\" the tendency to attribute our misery to our own flaws, to bad luck, or God's will. Ma Joad's solution is retrograde -- to hold the \"fambly\" together. Casey, on the other hand, discovers \"class consciousness.\" It's not our fault. The flaw is systemic, and the solution lies in correcting the inequities in the system. Our allegiance has to transcend groups like the family and embrace all the exploited workers. The film endorses not Marx's revolution but a milder form of socialism -- the government-run labor camp with its democratic \"sanitary units\", and the emerging union movement with its collective bargaining. Steinbeck's polemic is more acid. The novel has a reference to the extremely wealthy William Randolph Hearst (better known as Charles Foster Kane) who is described as have \"a mean face and a mouth like a a**hole.\" There aren't many references to communism either in the novel or the film, just a few remarks about \"Who is these Reds, anyways?\" Still pretty bold stuff for the 1930s with the public in one of its periodic Bolshevik scares!No need for anxiety, though. By the late 1930s the Great Depression was easing up, and World War II was about to bring it to an end. Bakersfield now looks as if Tom Joad had made a successful escape and decided to open a chain of organic food stores. This is a marvelous film. To single out just one shot, note when the Joads drive through the first starving Hooverville. The camera is mounted on the front of the old truck and travels slowly, without any cuts or dialog, through groups of wary, singularly ratty looking people, men and women, young and old, some resembling photos of criminals from old Police Gazettes, who \"don't look none too prosperous.\" If nothing else, the film is a valuable corrective to the current view that people are poor because they're lazy. How did one third of a nation become so terribly lazy in the years following the 1929 stock market crash?",

I was prepared to see some class-A drama but everything what this family goes through is even worse than I thought. This famous movie milestone goes about the Joad family. They have to leave everything they own in Oklahoma behind. Them and several other poor families are attracted by California because there is supposed to be work and a place to live. The long trip is filled with misery and when they finally get in California, it seems that they've been deceived once more. There's almost no food and 8 hungry mouths to fill. It's impossible not to get touched by the Joad family. All the characters are so sad but at the same time so brave. They don't give up and keep fighting...you just have to encourage them while watching this film. The Grapes of Wrath really makes you feel happy you live in this era and in this part of the world. You know stories like this really happened in the old days and they still do in some parts of the world. This kind of film is excellent to make you realize you have nothing to complain about.The dramatic highlights in this motion picture are countless : The flashbacks about how families are driven away from their homes, the grandfather's \"funeral\" , the mother and son conversation near the end... All these scenes and several other ones are indicators of great drama and brilliant cinema. The Grapes of Wrath received several prices and nominations and it deserved every single one of them. Every element in  it is flawless. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad is one of the most intriguing characters ever shown of the screen. He's absolutely brilliant.\nThe highest possible recommendation isn't yet high enough to describe The Grapes of Wrath...If you ever have the chance: SEE IT !",

                "Arguably Director John Ford's Greatest Film, although some might say \"The Searchers\" (1956) or \"My Darling Clementine\" (1946).But there is No Doubt that this Film Resonates and Captivates with its Story of the Depression's Devastating Effect on a \"Salt of the Earth\" Sharecropper Family with Multi-Generational Roots Planted in the Now Fallow \"Dust Bowl\".Along with the Personal Hardships the Movie makes much of the Social Separation and Income Inequality of the Time.There are the Compassion-Less Bankers and Their Minions of Law Enforcement and \"Tin Badge\" Thugs. Socialism/Communism was seen as an Alternative to the Punishing Poverty and Vanishing Opportunities by some and a Threat to Capitalism by the Capitalists.This is a Solid Background to the Story but Not the Backbone. The Skeletal Structure of the Movie, from John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize Winning Novel, is the Joad Family.Impeccably Acted by Henry Fonda (Tom Joad), Ma (Jane Darwell), and X-Preacher Casey (John Carradine), with Support from Charlie Grapewin (Grandpa), and John Qualen (Muley). The Remainder of the Strong Ensemble of Acting all do Excellent Work and the overall Verisimilitude of the Film is Striking.Gregg Toland's Haunting and Beautiful Cinematography Captures the Mood of Melancholy and the Film as a Whole is Widely Considered one of the Great Films.Some Film-Scholars even Rank it \"The Greatest\".

                "In which John Ford holds up John Steinbeck's black mirror to America at the end of a decade which started with the Stock Market Crash, continued with the Great Depression and ended with the nation contemplating its world position as Europe entered into war. The question posed by Steinbeck, amplified elegantly here by Ford, is what happens to the little people, the working class, indeed the underclass who get squeezed the most when the checks and balances in society break down. It's also about how fickle human nature becomes when the haves indeed have power over the have-nots and how cheaply some people can sell their humanity to maintain that superiority.The story is naturally episodic but the simple journey that the Joad family has to undertake to the much heralded promised land of California after being evicted from their land by the bank gives the movie a natural flow, although with this tale there are many more ebbs for the family to endure.My criticism of other Ford films has sometimes been the sentimentality and forced masculine humour he frequently inserts but there's no room for either of these traits here. The nearest we get to one of his familiar tropes is the weekend dance at the \"clean\" government camp at which the Joads eventually arrive and are for the first time treated humanely by the staff, but even amongst the high spirits there's danger in the wings as the state troopers seek to gatecrash the party to make an arrest.While there are twelve in the extended family which first hits the road, there are only eight of them alive by the time they reach the relative safe haven at the end as the elderly grandfather and grandmother expire on the journey and two others drop out. The main characters though are Henry Fonda's Tom Joad, the family matriarch Ma Joad played by Joan Darwell and the idealistic lapsed preacher Cristy, played by John Carradine. They each come to very different ends but the film does at least conclude on a vaguely optimistic note with stirring speeches of defiance and even hope by Fonda and Darwell, both of which in fact were interpreted by the soon to be all-powerful House Un-American Activities Committee as evidence of a Communist propaganda subtext.Oscar-nominated Fonda is excellent as the combative, already road-hardened Tom, just released from jail for killing a man, who soon becomes the head of the family and so supersedes his father and his father in the hierarchy. Darwell won the Oscar as the Mother Earth character whose indomitable spirit drives the family on while Carradine memorably portrays a man who has lost his faith and who now channels his energies into human rebellion.Ford (and screenwriter Nunnally Johnston), even if he does bend to the box-office by editing and tweaking events in the book to afford at least a smidgeon of optimism at the end, treats the text in a starkly realistic almost quasi-documentary style as befits the seriousness of the subject matter, aided in this by the masterful black and white photography of the acclaimed Greg Toland. The sense of abject poverty is manifest in the way Ford and Toland frame their cast's often gaunt portraits against dark skies and blasted landscapes.This classic movie is a literary adaptation, history lesson and cry for social reform all rolled into one.",

                "The Grapes of Wrath (1940) is a Drama History film in black and white starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. The film follows a poor Midwestern family during the depression who are being forced off their land. After being released from jail, Tom returns home to find it abandoned. He learns that the land is no longer producing enough crops to provide for their family and the whole family heads to California to look for work. The best parts of the film are the acting, the plot, and the cinematography. The acting and casting are excellent. The entire cast is full of life and they deliver their lines with perfect execution. When Tom Joad returns home to see his family, they are all lit up and full of smiles. You are able to see the happiness and utter joy that they are feeling to be reunited with a family member and you can sense the fear and anxiety that they are feeling regarding their upcoming move.The plot is riveting. Rarely do you see a historical film that is as much of a work of art as The Grapes of Wrath is. The story will take you into the Great Depression years ago and give you a glimpse at what a poor family during that time might have gone through. The timing of the script is great and will have you hoping for the main characters to be able to keep their home some way or at least find a nicer one. The plot allows for many emotional performances.The cinematography is excellent and professional. It proves that not only the cast and actors were perfect for the jobs, but the crew must have been as well. There are no shaky shots and there are no scenes where something is out of view that should be able to be seen by the camera and there are no scenes that were too zoomed in that you couldn't see anything. The camera pans between characters based on who is talking.I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys drama movies or anybody who is interested in history. Although this film is long (over 2 hours), there are no boring or dull parts in the film and it is definitely worth taking the time to watch it. Also, this film was made in the early 40s and it is in black and white. Even if you usually don't like or watch black and white films, I would recommend that you watch The Grapes of Wrath. This would also be an excellent film to show in history class when teaching about The Great Depression.The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent classic film that I would recommend to anyone regardless of whether or not they enjoy old films or black and white films. This film is worth the 2 hours that is takes to watch it because the acting, plot, and cinematography are phenomenal. The emotional scenes were executed to perfection and will leave you feeling sorry for the characters. The plot will have you interested in the beginning and the cinematography makes it easy to understand and see what is going on in the film. Overall this is an excellent film and deserves 10/10 stars.",

                "Steinbeck's classic comes to life. It's the dust bowl era and the depression. People are driven of their property by the banks. Of course, those banks got those people help getting that property and the depression was a complex collapse. Still, it's sad to see a portrayal of human misery. The Joads pack up everything and head west. Of course, there's the Woody Guthrie song \"If You Ain't Got the Dough Re Me.\" There really isn't an easy answer. California represents the great unknown where the streets are paved with gold and there's work and land for everyone. Naturally, the whole country was wallowing in poverty, and California was pretty well overextended. There's a point where all of us would say, 'It's either me or them.\" Henry Fonda who looks like Jane (or is it the other way around) is young Tom. He can't stand any more of the stuff his family must deal with. He is going to become enterprising. Unfortunately, he finds himself on the wrong side of the law. It's a group of socialists (some would call them dirty Commies) who come to the rescue with their collectivism setting things right. We see things through a filtered glass. John Ford had his own belief system. I felt good and clean when the Joads had some things look up for them, but I realize, also, that it's not so simple. Sometimes there are circumstances that don't qualify as evil--they just are. I hope that we can take a balanced view of the world and help those who need help.",

Sherwood (screenplay), Joan Harrison (screenplay), and Daphne Du Maurier (novel) is a Psychological Thriller Romance about a na\u00efve and unsophisticated, young woman that impulsively marries a wealthy widower, only to discover that he and his loyal housekeeper are still clinging to memories of his late wife, Rebecca. Themes of class, servitude, romance, and jealousy seem to dominate the narrative of this fish-out-of-water, whirlwind romance that hastily moves the awkward and nervous new bride (Joan Fontaine) into the fully-staffed seaside mansion &quot;Manderley&quot; of her paternalistic new husband, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). It&#39;s clear early on and all throughout the story, that the new bride&#39;s name is meant to be obscured, as she is only referred to and addressed as &quot;the young bride,&quot; &quot;madam,&quot; &quot;the child,&quot; &quot;darling,&quot; and &quot;dear.&quot; She meets the refined household staff, most of whom are gracious and welcoming, but quickly discovers that the stiff and formal, housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), does not approve of her. Mrs. Danvers is quite overt in her determination to psychologically bully the new Mrs. de Winter into thinking that the house (especially the west wing) should stay just as the greatly &quot;adored&quot; Rebecca left it (prior to drowning a year ago) and overtly convinces the new bride that her husband still loves his former wife. Mrs. Danvers&#39; behavior in addition to Maxim&#39;s outbursts, persistent distancing, and uncertainty about their marriage increase the new Mrs. de Winter&#39;s nervousness and clinginess. At mid-point, the new bride finally asserts that Rebecca&#39;s belongings should be removed, and she desperately tries to convince Maxim that they are happily married. At the heart of this story is a trifecta of psychological instability. The seemingly &quot;broken&quot; Maxim is reeling from the death of Rebecca, not because he misses her, but because he feels responsible for her death. The easily pleased, new Mrs. de Winter, believes she is in love with the man she married and hardly knows (and has no family of her own), so she is terribly desperate to make their relationship work. The openly hostile Mrs. Danvers is so fiercely loyal to her former mistress and so wholly disillusioned about Maxim&#39;s grief, that she has no qualms about pushing Maxim&#39;s new wife to the brink of suicide. What&#39;s especially clever (and ominous) about Rebecca is that each of the main characters is being driven mad by the title character we never get to see. When considering the extreme and tragic ending in relation to the set-up and second act development, I think the overall presentation would have been better served by spending less time establishing the short courtship and more time building up Mrs. Danver&#39;s rapidly evolving insanity."

Rebecca's sleazy cousin Jack Favell (George Sanders) appears at the house when Maxim is away.\nThe new Mrs. de Winter is intimidated by her responsibilities and begins to doubt her relationship with her husband. The continuous reminders of Rebecca overwhelm her; she believes that Maxim is still deeply in love with Rebecca. She also discovers that her husband sometimes becomes very angry at her for apparently innocent actions.\nTrying to be the perfect wife, the young Mrs. de Winter convinces Maxim to hold a costume party as he did with Rebecca. The heroine tries to plan her own costume, but Mrs. Danvers suggests she copy the beautiful outfit in the portrait of Caroline de Winter, an ancestor. At the party, when the costume is revealed to Maxim he is appalled; Rebecca wore the same outfit at their ball a year ago, shortly before she died. The heroine confronts Danvers, who tells her she can never take Rebecca's place, and almost manages to convince her to jump to her death. A sudden commotion reveals that a ship is sinking.\nThe heroine rushes outside, where she hears that during the rescue a sunken boat has been found with Rebecca's body in it. Maxim admits that he had earlier misidentified another body as Rebecca's, in order to conceal the truth. At the very beginning of their marriage Rebecca had told Maxim she intended to continue the promiscuous and perverse sex life she had led before the marriage. He hated her but they agreed to an arrangement: she would act as the perfect wife and hostess in public, and he would ignore Rebecca's privately conducted affairs. Rebecca grew careless and complacent in her dealings, including an ongoing affair with her cousin Jack Favell. One night, Rebecca informed Maxim that she was pregnant with Favell's child. During the ensuing heated argument she fell, hit her head and died. Maxim took the body out in a boat which he then scuttled.\nShedding the remnants of her girlish innocence, Maxim's wife coaches her husband on how to conceal the mode of Rebecca's death from the authorities. In the police investigation, deliberate damage to the boat points to suicide. Favell shows Maxim a note from Rebecca which seems to indicate she was not suicidal. Favell then tries to blackmail Maxim, but Maxim tells the police. Maxim is now under suspicion of murder. The investigation then focuses on Rebecca's secret visit to a London doctor (Leo G. Carroll), which Favell assumes was due to her illicit pregnancy. However, the coroner's interview with the doctor reveals that Rebecca was mistaken in believing herself pregnant; instead she had a late-stage cancer.\nThe doctor's evidence persuades the coroner to render a finding of suicide. Only Frank Crawley (Maxim's best friend and manager of the estate), Maxim, and his wife will know the full story: that Rebecca lied to Maxim about being pregnant with another man's child in order to goad him into killing her, an indirect means of suicide.\nAs Maxim returns home from London to Manderley, he finds the manor on fire, set alight by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. The second Mrs. de Winter and the staff manage to escape the blaze, but Danvers dies in the flames.",

                "This was Alfred Hitchcock's first American-made film. Quite frankly, I'm amazed at how well Hitchcock \"got\" what American audiences wanted in their suspense films, hitting them out of the park from the moment he began working in the US. Apart from being a tad bit long, this is a well made film. I love the inside of Mandalay and Sir Laurence Olivier played a wonderful mysterious and sullen Maximillian De Winter opposite his new wife, a beautiful and naive young Joan Fontaine who is never even given a name here, probably deliberately and in keeping with how mousy and \"second hand\" she feels about herself in relation to the first and late Mrs. De Winter, who is actually Rebecca from the title.Of course there is also George Sanders, playing the type of character he is best known for--sarcastic, snobby, self-assured, pompous, witty and verbose. He hits the nail on the head as Rebecca's \"cousin\" - so he calls himself. Of course the most eerie and unsettling character was Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's housekeeper or \"maid in waiting.\" Danvers takes great pains in sabotaging the second Mrs. De Winter's marital relationship with Max de Winter,--even going as far as calmly urging her to to plunge to her death into the water from Rebecca's bedroom window at Mandalay. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but I won't give them away. It's best if you watch them unfold yourself in true Hitchcockian style.I will say that Rebecca, the first wife of Max de Winter, is NEVER seen, but we learn about her by what is said about her by the various characters, even going as far as seeing the untouched shrine of a bedroom maintained by Mrs. Danvers. But soon you learn that Rebecca was never the perfect wife Danvers and others make her out to be. The ending is a surprise in more way than one, and yet Mrs. Danvers gets the last word in her own way. A great movie by Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick.",

                "I am 17, and I love this movie. One definite positive of Rebecca is the masterful direction by Alfred Hitchcock, full of the usual twists and turns that make his films so pleasing. The chilling and suspenseful story, of a timid young woman marrying a man and finding herself in the shadow of his dead first wife, has many complex issues, such as the possibilities of suicide, murder and mistaken identity, all of which took me completely by surprise. Rebecca also has gorgeous black and white cinematography, and a beautifully atmospheric music score. But it's the performances from the distinguished cast that holds this film together. Laurence Olivier, one of Britain's finest stage and film actors(you only have to see him in Shakespeare to know the talent this man had), gives a towering performance as Maxim De Winter, a broken man haunted by his first wife's death. The lovely Joan Fontaine is the picture of innocence and vulnerability as the 2nd Mrs De Winter, giving a genuine sense of fright and emotion throughout. Also superb is the suave George Sanders as the rather loathsome blackmailing Favel, who smirks and makes acidic remarks as effortlessly as Clark Gable did in Gone With The wind. But stealing the acting honours is Judith Anderson as the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, a performance that is truly sinister, like the scene when she sets Manderly on fire, her facial expression looking out of the window gave me the shivers. The script was tense, dark and flawlessly delivered. Through the characters we hear that Rebecca was beautiful and possessed all the other positive virtues, so I was shocked when that wasn't to be. All in all, a chilling and dark film, that is a must see. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",

                "Hitchcock felt 'Rebecca', his first Hollywood film, was a compromise, but as a viewer I just can't fault it. It's a masterpiece in my opinion, full of suspense, mystery and brooding atmosphere. It's also one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. I've watched it several times over the years, and even now that I know all the plot twists and turns (quite shocking on your first viewing), it never fails to hook me in. One of the reasons it really works is the flawless casting. I'm not much of an Olivier fan but he's superb as de Winter, with just the right mixture of charm and coldness. And Joan Fontaine is just perfect as de Winter's new bride. I can't spot an unconvincing moment in her performance and can't imagine any other actress in the role. Hitchcock subsequently used her in 'Suspicion' with Cary Grant. She was also excellent in that but 'Rebecca' is a much stronger movie. The supporting cast also includes some brilliant performances, especially Judith Anderson ('Laura') as the extremely creepy Mrs. Danvers, George Sanders who plays Rebecca's slimy cousin, and Nigel Bruce in a typical role as de Winter's bumbling brother-in-law Major Lacy. Sanders subsequently worked again with Hitchcock in 'Foreign Correspondent', and Bruce played Cary Grant's lovable pal \"Beaky\" in 'Suspicion'. I sometimes think that Hitchcock's 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too \"old fashioned\", but for me movies like 'Suspicion', 'Saboteur', 'Lifeboat' and 'Spellbound' are some of the most entertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and 'Rebecca' is the best of the lot.

                "Hitchcock's first American movie, a word, American that is, that should be put in quotes because as Hitchcock pointed out, all of the cast and almost all of the crew were British.  The film has already garnered so many comments that I'll avoid repeating most of them.  The plot I'm sure has been thoroughly outlined and professionally analyzed but a few points are worth emphasis.The plot of very precisely structured.  It consists basically of a man who is the dream of many women in the 1940s audience: ruggedly handsome, intelligent, keen witted, a bit commanding but not too much, fabulously wealthy, a touch roguish, and mysterious.  It's the mystery that provides the plot engine.  Every incident of his past emotional life needs to be pried out of Maxim deWinter (what a name, suggesting frigidity and distance) as if it were an abcessed tooth.  Each secret, as he reveals it, is a surprise to his wife.  Except for the final secret uncovered in the plot, which surprises everybody.  Maxim could clear the whole mystery up with an hour's worth of private conversation with his wife.  But of course he doesn't, or else there would be no story.  That's why Hamlet takes so long to slaughter Claudius.  And why the Indians don't shoot the horses as they're chasing the stagecoach.The acting.  Olivier is extremely good at impersonating deWinter with all his charm and challenge.  George Sanders is the best cad that the movies ever produced, and he proves it again here.  Mrs. Danvers has a face and an expression that looks like an ice sculpture.  The implicit lesbianism in her character of course had to remain implicit, but it is still rather a shock when she tenderly unfolds Mrs. DeWinter's nightie and says smoothly, \"Look, you can see my hand through it.\"  As for Joan Fontaine, a friend in Ireland said of her performance, \"She does the shivering wife very well.\" Precisely put.  With her delicate bone structure, fragile looking limbs, and her overall ikabani flower arrangement appearance, her wide asymmetrical eyes, with one brow arching up over her pale forehead, she looks about to faint with fright through half the movie.  The only thing coarse about her is her wardrobe: bulky knit sweaters over her girlish bosom, long flapping drab skirts over her small but saucy rump, and those clodhoppers she wears while clunking about the house.  She does the shivering naif in at least two other films of the period -- Hitchcock's \"Suspicion\" and \"Jane Eyre.\"  In fact, rummaging through the disarranged attic that is my long-term memory, I can't really remember her \"doing\" any other role.It's the closest Hitchcock ever came to making what was then called \"a woman's picture.\"  It received a \"best picture\" Oscar, which went to Selznick.  Something Hitchcock seemed to resent for the remainder of his life.  It was a commercial and critical success and it deserved to be.",

                "Alfred Hitchcock was and is still the undisputed Master of Suspense, and there is a lot of that here in his foray into Gothic horror, as the mystery surrounding the unseen yet omnipresent Rebecca will engage the viewer from its dreamy start to its bleak conclusion. This is exactly what atmospheric is supposed to be about, and in black and white, it shines. This is also what Gothic horror is in essence, and many have imitated yet come up short, most notably M. Night Shyamalan who, in trying to go for a shock twist and purported \"atmosphere\" only creates a bad aftertaste and a hangover the size of Mount Everest. This is, essentially, Hitchcock's first true masterpiece.Not one performance rings false, not to the novel or to their respective interpretations. Lawrence Olivier, quite possibly one of the greatest actors that ever lived, portrays a broken man who still lives haunted by the past as he himself were still living in that unending hell. Judith Anderson embodies one of the most coldly sadistic figures in cinema history, her smooth and elegant truculence only exceeded by Anthony Hopkins' rendition of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. One can't seem to understand the way she wallows in her dead mistresses' clearly perverse nature, but that exactly she does, right down to her own end. George Sanders does what he does best: sneer, smirk, and spit line after line of practiced venom, and would be honored 10 years later in ALL ABOUT EVE. Gladys Cooper, still striking in her 50s, plays into her casual cattiness which means no harm, although her rendition of Beatrice Lacy is a little subdued from the novel's version.And then there is Joan Fontaine. Not one of the best actresses on film, yet here, playing a role that evolves beautifully from a frightened, weak girl who is put into a situation she does not understand and who turns right at the point of losing it into a much more mature, strong woman capable of holding her own, she carries the weight of the entire drama and comes forth with flying colors. While I would have preferred Anne Baxter who would have been the exact right age for this role, Fontaine exudes so much restraint and nervousness about her character (partially to blame Olivier's treatment of her and Hitchcock's telling her the entire cast hated her), it's almost a relief when she finally decides to confront Olivier about what it the secret of Manderley. Not many roles require such a change and not many actresses would sink her teeth into a part that requires being put-upon until she can't stand no more, and this is one beautiful performance.A movie that should have won more Oscars that year, REBECCA has since grown in stature and proved that a film need not trophies to be Timeless and Great.",

                "Hitchcock - never won an Oscar - not in the Best Director department that is. He was nominated multiple times, but never got one. At least this movie right here won one for best movie. I know it is sometimes strange how a movie can win best movie, but the Director won't get one too.Anyway that does not change the perception most have of him: as one of the best directors that ever made movies. And he made lots of them thankfully. I finally came around watching this one - just before I went ahead and watched the \"remake\" that Netflix released last year. I put \"remake\" in quotes because the movie itself does try to establish itself as being based on the source novel.Now I have not read that, so I can't attest to all the changes that were made (although one was made for the ratings board considering the fate of Rebecca - and that was also used in the Remake). Humor was added though apparently and I would guess that the actors made their roles their own. In combination with what Hitchcock was able to get out of them.Many takes on the most simple things apparently and even a lot of looping (dubbing) of lines that he wasn't too keen of. But I've written so much and have not even touched the surface of what makes this movie great.You have a movie that is about the role of a woman - a second wife no less. A movie that seems to tell so many stories - but especially a story that concentrates on the female main character. Some have claimed that Hitchcock was a misogynist. On the other hand the extras here and some feminist claim the exact opposite. Even in his (infamous) interview with Truffaut, some might say it became clear he was more feminist than he liked to admit.And the movie right here seems to be able to capture many feelings of women. Even add some bi-sexual or lesbian love? You could read that into it - maybe it is in the book too. Again, I can't really tell.Every frame here is planned into the smallest detail. Nothing is left to chance and coincidence. There is a reason he is considered a master. The performances of the couple is amazing - Olivier may not be easy to read, but that is again on purpose.You also have the whole theme of romance and the age gap ... love, betrayal, addiction ... so many themes woven in here. And the overall presence of ... Rebecca. A presence that is felt throughout ... while never seen. And yet it is better this ... it is perfect as it is.",

                "Director Alfred Hitchcock is renowned for his visual acuity, creating some of the most memorable shots in movie history; he also had a keen eye for beauty, casting some of Hollywood's most stunning actresses in iconic roles: Grace Kelly in Rear Window, Maureen O'Hara in Jamaica Inn, Tippi Hedren in The Birds, Ingrid Bergman in Spellbound, and Janet Leigh in Psycho, to name but a few. Perhaps his most enchanting leading lady was Joan Fontaine, who won an Oscar for her role in Suspicion (1941), but who was never more appealing than in her first film for Hitch, Rebecca, based on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier.The gorgeous Fontaine plays a meek young woman (we never discover her name, but she's not the 'Rebecca' of the title) who falls for rich aristocrat 'Maxim' de Winter (Laurence Olivier) while working in the South of France. Equally besotted, Maxim proposes to the self-effacing beauty, and takes her back to his ancestral home, Manderley, which he once shared with his first wife Rebecca, before she drowned in a boating accident. The new Mrs. de Winter does her best to adapt to her new lifestyle, but is constantly under the shadow of her predecessor, with stern housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) being particularly disapproving of Maxim's new bride, deliberately driving a wedge between the married couple and even going so far as to try and talk Mrs. de Winter Mk. II into killing herself.Thus far, the film is pure melodrama and sappy romance, and avid Hitchcock fans might be wondering where the murder and mystery is; worry, not, for this comes in the second half of the film and provides plenty of intrigue and suspense as Maxim reveals what really happened to his first wife and is subsequently suspected of her murder. Both his wife and the viewer are aware of his innocence, but with Rebecca's lover Jack Favell (George Sanders) accusing Mr. de Winter of murder, and plenty of damning evidence, things are looking pretty bad for the poor fellow. It all wraps up nicely in the end, of course, but there are plenty of tense moments along the way, all handled in the director's typically assured manner, with bags of atmosphere and sumptuous cinematography.But as great as the direction and story are, it is the performances that really make Rebecca a winner: Olivier is perfect as the troubled toff, Anderson is wonderfully wicked as scheming housekeeper Danvers, nobody does 'bumbling oaf' quite as well as Nigel Bruce (playing Major Giles Lacy, who puts his foot in his mouth whenever he speaks), Sanders is suitably slimy as adulterous blackmailer Favell, and Fontaine... well, she is completely captivating, every smile, every tilt of her head, and every nervous glance guaranteed to win over the viewer (she was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the Oscars, but lost to Ginger Rogers).

                "Rebecca is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screen play from the Daphne du Maurier novel of the same name. It stars Laurence Olvier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Cinematography is by George Barnes and music scored by Franz Waxman.After meeting and marrying 'Maxim' de Winter (Olivier), the Second Mrs. de Winter (Fontaine), finds life at his English estate, Manderley, far from comfortable because the servants and the house serve to remind her of the first Mrs. de Winter, whose death remains a source of mystery. What did happen to the first lady of the house? Can this newly married couple survive the oppressive cloud that looms large over the mansion?A Gothic emotional near masterpiece, Alfred Hitchcock's first American film may seem a bit too serviceable at times, something he was also aware of himself, but the production values are high and the story is played out supremely well. Within the story we can find Hitchcock's now famous trait of mistrusting Women, but in the main it stays the tragic tale of one young woman living in the ominous shadow of the previous Mrs. De Winter. Mood is often set as foreboding, with the director understanding the psychological pangs of the source material once the action switches to the de Winter home of Manderley. It arguably is a touch too long, and the restraint of Hitchcock, down to producer David O. Selznick overseeing things, stops it being a bit more unnerving than it should be.For Manderley the mansion here is one of the finest put on the screen, this is because Hitchcock and brilliant cinematographer George Barnes manage to make it bold & beautiful one minute, and then the next scene it comes off as a monolithic nightmare. It's wonderful case of the surroundings playing the extra character for maximum effect. Laurence Olivier is impressive, even if we would learn later on that this is the sort of performance he could do in his sleep. The supporting cast do great work as well, especially as regards the cold and terrifying turn from Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. However, to me this will always be Joan Fontaine's show, she nails it perfectly, the new Mrs. De Winter wants to do right but can't seem to so for doing wrong, she infuriates at times, yet the next minute you just want to hold her, for she's so vulnerable, but beautifully so, it's a brilliant performance in a brilliant film. The ending is a switheroo from the novel, and it almost derails the success the film has achieved up to that point. And looking at it now it's hard not to curse the Production Code for enforcing a big change to what was revealed in du Maurier's wonderful novel. But the film has survived the \"appeasing\" ending to stand the test of time for all the ages. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Barnes also won for Best Black & White Cinematography, it was nominated for a further nine awards, including Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. No nomination for Waxman, sadly, but his score is worthy of a mention for the evocative strains that sit nicely with the tone of the story.

So if you happen not to know the story, it's a good idea to see the film before reading a lot of comments about it.

                "I spent the majority of this film thinking about how lucky M. Olivier really was. To be able to wrap his arms around Joan Fontaine and kiss her. Oh my. She's one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen (almost, but not quite as beautiful as Veronica Lake). She's also absolutely perfect in the role of the second Mrs. DeWinter, taking a character that could have become a cloying bore in less capable hands and transforming her into a sympathetic and interesting figure.The movie, on the whole, is similarly amazing, capturing the spirit and the tone of those great Gothic romances. Watching Rebecca, I was reminded (pleasantly) of Wuthering Heights; I do not mean to suggest that in some way this film re-tells the tale of Cathy and Heathcliff, but rather that Rebecca has the feel of Bronte's novel (I am most certainly not talking about the William Wyler adaptation a few years before the release of Rebecca. That's a terrible film that somehow manages to mis-interpret the novel).I must assume that the guiding hand of Hitchcock played no small role in recreating the feel of a Gothic romance. There are very few that would be able to take a love story, infuse it with such gloom, with such a sense of foreboding, and still manage to create something that ends happily without it feeling like a cop-out. I'd also like to draw everyone's attention to the incredibly moving section of the film that occurs between the arrival of the second Mrs. DeWinter at Mandalay and the masqued ball. The emotional strain on the Joan Fontaine character is so palpable, so absolutely taxing, that it actually pains me to watch. I hurt along with her.

It is rare to find a film like this, as it tackles various genres, ranging from being a romance to a mystery to a drama to even a comedy at times, and all without seeming pretentious. The cast is truly magnificent. Judith Anderson is a stunner is a quiet but sinister role, and George Sanders is even more impressive in lively but also sinister performance. Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are perfect for their roles too. The film won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Cinematography quite deservingly \u0096 this is one of the best films Hollywood has ever produced.",

Place a pair of pince-nez on the bridge of your nose and witness two great stars, Joan Fontaine is outstanding, add immense depth to an already deep, dark and disturbing tale with some sinister supporting characters thrown in for good measure, none more so than Judith Anderson as the mysterious and cryptic Mrs. Danvers.",

                "Rebecca (1940)Ah, to see another great movie from those few years when Hollywood peaked, when that combination of art, freshness, and sheer collaborative talent combined over and over. I'm talking from Gone with the Wind to Casablanca, 1939 to 1942. Throw in any number of truly staggering movies in the stretch--Citizen Kane for starters--and we have to almost expect Alfred Hitchcock to fit right in. With Rebecca he does. It's another perfect movie.Daphne Du Maurier's book of the same title is a great read, something short of a literary classic but something better than a mere best-seller. I read it recently, and was completely transported into a land of subtle drama. That sounds like an oxymoron, but when you see this movie you'll notice how people act with restraint, with glances, with quiet actions, and yet achieve a grandiose, dramatic effect that tears your heart out. It's an archetypal story about a girl who seems to have a dream come true marrying a charming and very wealthy man.But of course, there are skeletons in this man's closet, and Lawrence Olivier plays the inner struggle of Maxim close to the chest. More openly troubled by events, and so sympathetic your heart jumps out of your chest, is the girl, his wife, played by Joan Fontaine. Now here is a performance that is just incredible. She even changes her presence as her innocence slowly bleeds away from start to finish. If the two of them never quite have sparks fly, they're not supposed to. But Hitchcock has done more than chosen a great, cinematic novel and two amazing actors (as well as a flawless supporting cast). With the most romantic, lush sets, delirious lights, and rich, layered photography, all fluidly combined to create scenes so beautiful you can almost taste it, the director has shown, again, that he understands the intuitive power of the cinema. It isn't the outward brilliance of any one scene or shot, or any one conversation that the camera follows invisibly, or any flinging of the curtains to reveal only more fog or sheer obscurity. It's the pacing and sequence of these moments that sucks you into the world and won't let you go.Well, it's no surprise, maybe, that Rebecca won best picture and best cinematography at the Oscars. And it was up against The Letter, The Grapes of Wrath, and The Philadelphia Story, all of which are more proof that the movies of this period are a zenith of a certain kind of Hollywood. The studio system. (Yes, there are hundreds of other great movies from other years, but I'm not really trying to make my case here.) Hitchcock never won an Oscar for best director (neither did Welles), but he could have here without fault. As much as this is just a movie to get lost in and enjoy, it's also a movie you could watch over and over and study.",

                "David O. Selznick might have had more of an influence over this production than some might think- as with many of his films- and he is the one who ended up receiving the Oscar, not director Alfred Hitchcok, for the 1940 mystery-drama-romance Rebecca. But it is to the credit of both that, for the most part, it looks as if both tried to stay out of each other's way and just put up as good as film as they could. And it is a credit to Hitchcock that with a certain change from what one might see in his perhaps more entertaining films of the 50's and 60's also shows his knack at making great romantic Hollywood movie-making. He is given a plethora of the best of English acting talents (Olivier of course is hyped and hyped again just like Brando, but his work is undeniably good here, and yet it's Joan Fontaine who quietly makes her mark quite powerfully even when she is reserved in scenes), lush sets and production decor, a solid 'studio' score by Frank Waxman, and some memorable sequences and set-pieces. There is also some solid storytelling as well with his usual knack at unraveling a mystery piece by piece, with love, loss and deception at the core.Part of the film's success, however, is as attributable to the factor of it being one of the best \"chick-flicks\" in history that the film works today. And this time I mean it pretty much as a compliment, perhaps more to Selznick than anyone (Gone with the Wind, of course). The appeal that might usually go mostly for women is not lost at all on the male audience due to the sheer power and hints at what the two main actresses go for. Fontaine is the \"2nd\" Mrs. De Winter, who elopes with the Mr. played by Olivier and goes to live in Manderlay and meets some of the family and other folks. One of these is the one who has maybe the most interesting (naturally, as the antagonist) character, Mrs. Danvers played by Judith Anderson. Her's is a cold, exacting kind of character who has the straightforward, stern attitude of the ma'am of the house, but also with some dark secrets. It's not to say Hitchcock doesn't hav his eye out for other supporting parts and characters (I liked particularly the old guy who's at the shack where the majority of the secrets are house). But he also is able to get the character the audience will dislike the most as the more fascinating of the bunch, and Anderson is up to task.I wouldn't rush to see this as the first Hithcock film to see if you haven't seen one yet, but as an example of what he could direct aside from his outrageous and masterpiece works in the following years this is a fit example. It's also got, basically, an excellent story, and is pumped up with the best of Hollywood decorum and spectacle, with a big fire of an ending that practically on its own makes it worthwhile enough to see.",

                "In Monte Carlo, the shy and naive lady's companion (Joan Fontaine) of the snobbish Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) meets the wealthy widower aristocrat Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) in the hotel while her employer is ill. They spend many days together and they fall in love for each other. When the youth is ready to travel to New York with Mrs. Van Hopper, Maxim proposes her and they get married to each other. The now Mrs. de Winter discovers that Maxim is disturbed with the loss of his first wife Rebecca, who died when her boat sank with her alone nearby his manor Manderlay. They travel to Manderlay, where Mrs. De Winter has a cold reception from the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who worshiped Rebecca. Along the days, the humble Mrs. de Winter is frightened by the omnipresence of perfect Rebecca through the arrogant Mrs. Danvers. However, when the boat of Rebecca is found with her body trapped in the cabin, Mr. and Mrs. de Winter are haunted by the past.\"Rebecca\" is probably is one of the most famous movies of Alfred Hitchcock in his earlier career, with a suspenseful romance with many surprises and twists. The performance of the fragile Joan Fontaine is amazing with her innocent expression and clumsy attitudes in an aristocratic world that does not belong to her, a simple working class young woman. Inclusive her character does not even have a name. Laurence Olivier makes a couple without chemistry with Joan Fontaine, in the role of a millionaire with a shadow from the past. The introduction, with Joan Fontaine telling her dream, misguides the viewers and I expected a different fate for the lead couple. George Sanders is the perfect scumbag and Judith Anderson performs a creepy character that might be homosexual grieving a non-corresponded love with Rebecca. The cinematography in black-and-white is very beautiful but the DVD released by the Brazilian distributor Continental is not remastered.

It was the only Hitchcock movie to win a Best Picture Oscar and it was his first Hollywood film after leaving England. This was also the first film in which he adapted someone else's work, the famous novel by de Maurier.This film features all the twists and strange characters you would expect from Hitchcock along with the trademark unexpected ending.

                "\"Rebecca\" was the first Hitchcock film I ever saw, and I was mesmerized by it from the start, convinced that I had to see more of the director's work. It richly deserved the Oscar it received, but it's a real puzzle that the Academy saw fit to withhold a best director award for Hitch.  Would one possibly give an award to a work by Picasso and not to Picasso himself?\"Rebecca\" was the first of the director's American-made films, and it shows. It's quite different from his earlier British-made films, such as \"Young and Innocent\" and even \"The Lady Vanishes,\" which somehow seem more amateurish by comparison.  (I know little of the British cinema of that era, but it's difficult not to conclude that Hollywood was better at producing more sophisticated efforts.)  I would even judge \"Rebecca\" the best of his films of the early 1940s, with the possible exception of \"Shadow of a Doubt.\"  It is true, of course, that much of this film has become clich\u00e9 (remember the spoofs on the old \"Carol Burnette Show\"!), but it still weathers the decades very well.  The acting is uniformly excellent.  Olivier is the hardened Maxim de Winter, untitled lord of Manderly, trying to forget the past and given to unexpected bouts of anger and coldheartedness. Fontaine is perfect as the unnamed mousy heroine, innocent yet deeply in love, still carrying with her the aura of an awkward schoolgirl.  Even character actor Nigel Bruce, best known for his role in the Sherlock Holmes films, makes an appearance and plays, in effect, Nigel Bruce!But it is Judith Anderson's role as Mrs. Danvers that viewers are likely to remember best.  Her presence is as dark and foreboding as that of the deceased Rebecca herself, and Fontaine is evidently cowed by her icy stare and unnervingly formal manner.  The dynamics between the two actresses are wonderful.  Who could fail to empathize with Fontaine's unenviable position as, in effect, the new employer of such an intimidating personage?  On the other hand, Olivier seems quite unfearful of Anderson, despite her representing so much of the past he is trying to block out.  This part of the plot (even in the book) never made much sense to me and is unconvincing.As far as I know, this film marked Hitch's first collaboration with composer Franz Waxman, whose haunting score makes it all the more memorable. Waxman's scores are perhaps less obviously cinematic than those of the incomparable Bernard Herrmann, who would score Hitch's films from 1955 to 1966.  Contrast the score for \"Rebecca\" to Herrmann's music for \"Citizen Kane\" the following year, and you'll immediately hear the difference. Waxman's is more symphonic in the central European style reflective of his own birth and upbringing.  Yet it is worth recalling that scoring films was still a new art at this time, and both Waxman and Herrmann were pioneers.Finally, one has to mention the cinematography, which is magnificent. Technically \"Rebecca\" might have been filmed in colour, which was newly available in 1940.  (\"Gone with the Wind\" was filmed entirely in colour the previous year, while \"The Wizzard of Oz\" and \"The Women\" had colour scenes.) But colour would have diminished its impact.  The suspense and the ominous sense of impending doom could only have been communicated through the medium of black-and-white and the deft use of light and shade which it affords.In one respect, of course, \"Rebecca\" is not a typical Hitchcock film.  There is no fleeing innocent trying to clear his name of a crime he did not commit.  Surprisingly, there isn't even a murder, although its absence was apparently imposed by the Hayes Code and is certainly foreign to Daphne du Maurier's original novel.  Some have said that there is more Selznick than Hitchcock in this film, and perhaps there's something to that.  Still, if the collaborative effort between the two was not exactly amiable, it was nevertheless successful.In short, this is the first in a string of Hitchcock masterpieces.",

                "This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Definitely my favorite classic. There are some that come close, such as Citizen Kane, Spellbound, and Psycho, but none quite compare to this amazing movie.The first thing that you notice is the outstanding cinematography. You have to remember that this movie was made in 1940, when they didn't have the technology we have now. But that first shot of the water beating up against the rocks grabs you and for one split second you wonder if maybe this isn't part of the movie but rather something filmed just recently. But then you see the familiar face of Laurence Olivier, reminding you that this was made 60 years ago, a fact that forever amazes me. The only oscar it won besides Best Picture was well deserved.Another thing that makes it such a wonderful film is the acting. I have debated on whether Laurence Olivier's character, the tortured Maxim de Winter, is the pitiable character or if his second wife played by Joan Fontaine is really the one to feel sorry for. Every time I watch it I see it from a different point of view. Joan Fontaine is excellent. Laurence Olivier is wonderful, but that's no surprise. The only thing that bugs me is that it seems in every movie he's in (well, at least, everything I've seen him in), he always plays the same type of character.  But he's extremely good at it, so I suppose it doesn't matter.But although Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier are wonderful, Judith Anderson steals the show! The first time I watched the movie, I was immediately grabbed by her stunning performance as the sinister Mrs. Danvers. You hardly notice the other characters when she's in the scene. She acted the part so well that it's strange to imagine that she was any different in real life.With a wonderful storyline, and a very surprising ending, Rebecca well deserves the title as the only of Hitchcock's films to win the oscar for Best Picture. Although it may not be the most famous of all his films, it is without a doubt the greatest",

                "This review won't be accepted gracefully on this website but at least I am honest in telling you this was a big disappointment to me, considering all the great reviews I read (not here) prior to seeing it. Some of that praise is simply because it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie with \"Hitch\" being a big favorite among national critics.Even though I own a good amount of classic films, this was way too slow, way too corny and old-fashioned. I should re-purchase this film and use it the next time time I have trouble getting to sleep at night.Joan Fontaine has a nice, pretty wholesome face but that's about it. Her character in this was just plain stupid and got worse as the film wore on, especially at the end. Judith Anderson, whom I read was so \"creepy\" in this, was not anywhere near as evil as built up to be. As usual, the real-life wacko, George Sanders, is the most interesting actor in the film.Having said all that, I do want to highly praise the sets and camera effort of this movie. The best part of this melodrama was the cinematography with some wonderful scenes inside \"Mandaly\" (the mansion). The cameras did a great job with the use of shadows, some of the best I've ever seen. Without the visual treats, I doubt I could have stayed with this 130-minute film.",

                "I've always found it curious that of all the films Alfred Hitchcock directed Rebecca was the one that wound up with the Best Picture Oscar and that Hitchcock didn't receive Best Director for it. Usually those two go together. John Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director for The Grapes of Wrath that year instead. Also Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson were nominated and all came up short.Off the top of my head I would say Vertigo, North By Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, and Spellbound are all qualitatively better than Rebecca. Yet Rebecca does have a nice Gothic horror feel to it though there is nothing supernatural going on here.Laurence Olivier plays Maxim DeWinter, heir to the estate of Manderley who is in Monte Carlo looking to get away from the place because of the death of his first wife Rebecca. She was by all accounts a regal beauty who was the toast of society and he's in mourning for her loss. But he meets Joan Fontaine a nice, but plain sort of girl who is the paid companion of American dowager Florence Bates. Maybe because she's the opposite of Rebecca he's attracted to her. Fontaine grabs him on the spot when marriage is proposed.Fontaine has a lot of insecurities much like her character in a following Hitchcock film, Suspicion. They're not eased any by Judith Anderson the housekeeper of the big Manderley estate.Mrs. Danvers was Judith's career role. Before writing this review I remarked to someone else that I wonder what Mr. Danvers must have been like. It occurred to me later that there was no Mr. Danvers, he exists only as an excuse or a pretense so there would be no whispers about her unmarried status. She pretends to be a widow. There's more than just latent lesbianism in Judith Anderson's portrayal. She was totally in love with the late Rebecca DeWinter and I'm sure it got good and physical. She can't stand seeing anyone else in taking her place. Since it comes out that Rebecca was fooling around with her cousin George Sanders, why not a lesbian affair as well. If Rebecca were written today, Mrs. Danvers would be more openly lesbian.Rebecca was the first of Alfred Hitchcock's American films as well, though it was done here it was done by the English colony in Hollywood. Hitchcock never had budgets that Selznick gave him over in the UK. The sets depicting the grandeur of Manderley are an eye full. Than again so were the sets of Tara in Selznick's Best Picture of the previous year, Gone With the Wind.Rebecca is a good mixture of mystery, Gothic horror, and romance served up quite nicely by Alfred Hitchcock.",

                "I pretty much ignored this film when I first saw. Having gained a great appreciation for Hitchcock and having studied his films and read widely about his work, I have come to appreciate this more than some think I should. I bought a copy of the movie, but I forced myself to read the book again (it had been about 30 years, when, out of curiosity, I read it). It is a book full of wonderful atmosphere, a bit sappy in places, but has that Gothic appeal that I love. When I got the film out, I was ready, and found myself caught up in the wonderful story. Like Jane Eyre, there is that secret that becomes a part of the decay of Manderly. It can't become alive again until things have been resolved. With a masterful hand, Hitchcock delicately brings his camera around and around and peeks in the shadows, bringing threat from every corner of the mansion. I don't think the acting is average. Olivier is at his best, again, as in Wuthering Heights, standing above his ghosts. If there is a weakness, it's not in the film, but in the book. What are Olivier's motive sin marrying the girl if he was to resign her to the coldness of her new environment. How clueless was he about the hatred directed toward his young wife. Was he totally unaware that Rebecca could hold forth even in her death? Still, even though Sir Alfred didn't really like doing this film and probably butted heads with his producer, it is a work of incredible craftsmanship and when it is over, it makes one feel the great loss. Like \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" the cracks in the foundation are what this story is all about. If it had been made today, it would probably have brought down the characters as well.",

Each boy has his own story and a reputation to follow. Chris comes from a family renowned for their dishonesty and abusive nature, which gives him a bad rap despite his tough but kind disposition. Teddy, rather eccentric, is recognizable by the mangled remains of his right ear which his mentally unstable father held down to a hot stove top. His father resides in a mental institution but Teddy speaks highly of him for serving in WWII. The fourth of their group and the butt of many jokes, portly Vern Tessio (\nJerry O'Connell\n), begs to be let in the tree house, saying he has important news. The others make light fun of him until he asks if they want to go see a dead body. They all fall silent as he explains that, while looking for a misplaced penny jar under his porch, he overheard his older brother Billy (\nCasey Siemaszko\n) and friend Charlie Hogan (\nGary Riley\n) discuss how Billy found the body of Ray Brower, a kid who had recently gone missing. Gordie and his friends followed the story closely because Ray was around their age, last seen picking blueberries in the woods outside of town. Billy says the kid must have been hit by a train and refuses to report the discovery to the police because he was at the site in a stolen car.\nGordie and the others decide to go find the body and accept recognition as local heroes. They make plans to tell their parents they're sleeping over at each other's homes the next day and to meet the next morning on the train tracks leading out of town. Come morning, Gordie goes to fetch his canteen in his older brother's room. A few months prior his brother, Denny (\nJohn Cusack\n), a popular athlete, died in a car accident. Gordie's mother (\nFrances Lee McCain\n) has been silent and distant since then and his father (\nMarshall Bell\n) asks him why he can't have friends like Denny's or play sports like him. He has no interest in his son's aspirations to become a writer and criticizes Chris for stealing milk money at school. The only support Gordie received was from his brother who gave him an old Yankee cap, something he now cherishes.\nGordie meets Chris in town who takes him to a back alley and shows him the gun he swiped from his father's bureau. Gordie lightly takes aim at a garbage can and pulls the trigger, thinking it's not loaded. It is. It fires and sends the two running for the main street where they come across a few members of a gang led by Ace Merrill (\nKiefer Sutherland\n). Chris's older brother, Eyeball (\nBradley Gregg\n) leers at the boys as Ace steals Gordie's cap and threatens Chris with a lit cigarette. They let the boys go unharmed and walk away, laughing. Gordie and Chris meet up with Teddy and Vern at the train tracks where they realize no one's brought food. They take out their money and agree to buy something along the way. As a train approaches, everyone but Teddy gets off the tracks. Teddy imitates shooting an automatic at the train, intent on dodging it at the last second, 'just like my father in Normandy'. Chris, however, pulls him off before the stunt can be performed and yells at him for nearly killing himself.\nThey soon arrive at a local junkyard that is rumored to house a disgruntled owner with a ferocious dog named Chopper which he's supposedly trained to attack any intruders, going right for the person's balls. However, the yard is empty and the four rest in the shade of a car hood for a few minutes while Gordie, after losing a race, goes to retrieve food at the store on the other side. On his way back, he notices the others scrambling over the yard fence and turns just in time to see the owner, Milo Pressman (\nWilliam Bronder\n), emerge, yelling for Chopper. Due to the dog's legendary reputation, when Milo shouts for Chopper to 'sick 'em, boy', Gordie imagines that what Milo's saying is 'sick balls'. Gordie frantically runs for the fence with the dog close on his heels but makes it over the top. He turns and sees that Chopper (\nPopeye\n) is not the dog he'd expected. Milo rushes over to the fence and berates the four boys for making fun of his dog. Teddy throws a few insults but is shocked silent when Milo calls his father a loony. Teddy breaks down, shouting that his father stormed the beach at Normandy, and has to be led away by the others.\nFollowing the train tracks, they come to a bridge. They hesitate to cross, unsure of when the next train is due. Feeling confident, they begin to cross with Chris and Teddy in the lead and Gordie trailing behind Vern, who's chosen to crawl instead of walk. Midway, Vern loses a comb that he packed in his shirt pocket which he'd hoped to use once they found the body and reported it to the local news. Gordie consistently looks back and bends down to feel the rails. A light vibration leads him to see plumes of smoke in the distance. He shouts \"TRAIN!\" and yells at Vern to get to his feet and run. They are barely able to make it to the other side and off the tracks. Chris jokes that now, at least, they know when the next train is.\nAs they continue deeper into the forest, Chris lags behind with Gordie who is despondent about being a writer and doesn't think much of his talents. Chris tries to encourage him, saying that he wishes he was his father instead so that he could give him proper guidance and support. They set up camp for the night and Gordie tells them all a story about a kid named Lardass Hogan (\nAndy Lindberg\n), stuck with such a name because of his weight. Sick and tired of being made fun of for his considerable size, Lardass takes revenge on the rest of his town by forcing himself to violently throw up during a blueberry pie eating contest. What ensues is a comedic chain reaction of perpetual barfing.\nThe boys decide to sleep in shifts and Gordie takes the opportunity, while Vern and Teddy sleep, to talk to Chris alone. Chris confides in him that he hates his family name and the association he has with them, wishing to leave to start fresh somewhere and actually make something of himself. He reveals that he did take the milk money at school first but felt remorseful about it and returned it to one of the teachers, who happened to show up to school the next day in a brand new dress. Chris took the heat for the theft but could never atone to it because of his family's reputation.\nThe next morning, Ace and his gang are seen spending recreational time smoking and hitting mailboxes with baseball bats as they drive through their neighborhood. Billy and Charlie draw Ace's attention with their silence and they finally blab about finding Ray's body. Intent on claiming credit for himself, Ace heads out with them, along with Vince Desjardins (\nJason Oliver Lipsett\n) and Eyeball.\nMeanwhile, Gordie and the others take a shortcut through the woods and land in a swamp infested with leeches. They strip down and Gordie finds one attached to his lower extremities, fainting after removing it. Eventually, they come back to the tracks and discover Ray's body (\nKent W. Luttrell\n), knocked clean out of his shoes and lying in some bushes. They decide to build a stretcher for him and Gordie breaks down, crying that his father truly hates him and knowing that he favored Denny.\nAt that moment, Ace and the rest of the gang appear and demand that the boys leave so they can take the body. Chris insults him and Ace pulls out a knife before Gordie fires the gun in the air. He threatens Ace, saying it'll be all too easy to kill him, and Ace leaves. Gordie announces that no one will get the credit for finding Ray; they will instead report it through an anonymous call.\nThey return to town with Gordie narrating that it seemed so much smaller after their journey. As the boys split up and head home, Gordie narrates that Vern and Teddy grew distant over the next few years. Vern married straight out of high school, had four children, and became a fork lift driver at a lumberyard. Teddy attempted to join the army but was rejected due to his poor eyesight and ear injury. He eventually served some jail time and performed odd jobs around Castle Rock. Chris managed to stick it in school with Gordie and went to college to become a lawyer. However, it's revealed that he was stabbed and killed when he tried to break up a fight in a fast food restaurant; the very article Gordie read at the start of the film.\nGordie closes the film as he finishes a memoir he's been writing about his childhood and leaves to take his son and friend (\nChance Quinn\nand\nJason Naylor\n) out swimming.",

                "Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.Stand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it's a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.These are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends. That's what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad, but there's a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult.Teddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there's Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.The acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.10/10",

                "Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history, Stephen King. Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O'Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.Stand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959, the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting, and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train, hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately, the town's bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason, which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story, it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also, every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways, making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on, Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers, not to mention Chris's cruel brother, and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene, Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father's alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove, nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father, who hadn't laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught `eating bleach under the sink.'Stephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film, such as in Gordie's vehement line, `F*ck writing. I don't want to be a writer, it's a stupid waste of time!' Not only that, but there are also obvious references to his other works, such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food, and Teddy says, `This is great, what are we supposed to do, eat our feet?' People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King's short stories, `Survivor Type,' from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don't you people read these books? `The Body,' which Stand By Me was based on, is only 148 pages long, you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It's even more disturbing that `The Body' was published in the same book (Different Seasons) as a couple of King's other famous stories \u0096 `Apt Pupil' and, of course, `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.'Stand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are, but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film \u0096 `As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern, until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes, friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.' Instead, the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it, and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.Stand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King's story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner, and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels, with the slicked back hair, the hot rods, and in the film, and excellent 50s soundtrack. There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story \u0096 things about the characters and the story, but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all.",

                "Perhaps this is a personal bias because I had friends like this when I was 12, but having said that this is one of the best films I have ever seen and it hits every chord perfectly.There were four of us that were friends and we were known as the Stand By Me Crew. Mike, Gary, Andy and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.The story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about, it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.The four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'ConnellCoosh from Jerry Maguire ), Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.What Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.The last line of the movie is so true.

Although growing up is tough, the friends you have at a young age are the friends you'll remember for the rest of your life. Stand By Me is a very wonderful film, a masterpiece on a small scale. The film is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys who decide they want to see what a dead body looks like, and it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy's mind is full of many things, they feel lost sometimes, strong at others, but mostly they feel invinceable.

                "I saw Stand By Me yesterday for the first time in one and a half years, (I'm 17) and I absolutely loved it, and it is definitely one of my favourite Stephen King adaptations. I will say I absolutely loved Shawshank Redemption, and despite the fact that it was unfaithful to the book, and badly flawed, I liked It too.Stand By Me, based on the novella by Stephen King, which I admit I haven't read, not only has a wonderfully engaging story, but it is both funny and moving. This is helped by the strong and wholly believable performances from the entire cast that include Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conell and River Pheonix especially.The script was very well-crafted, and the film tells brilliantly of the values of friendship and standing together. Other strengths were the beautiful photography and the fine direction from Rob Reiner. But what impressed me most about Stand By Me was not only its nostalgic feel, but despite the hour and a half running time, the characters particularly Chris were so well developed. And I mustn't forget the beautiful song Stand By Me over the end credits.A beautiful, unforgettable film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox.",

                "I find it hard to comment on this film without simply repeating what has already been said. It's not that I can't think of anything original, but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.I saw this movie when I was about 12, 13, maybe 14 years old. So it didn't have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.The 'milk-money' scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.This movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend's shoulder.I guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you'll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, \"a great time\"I especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough. I loved the last scene with Chris and Gordie, and the closing monologue.\"I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve...Jesus....does anyone?\"",

                "\"It happens sometimes. Friends come in and out of our lives, like busboys in a restaurant.\"Stand By Me is Rob Reiner's love letter to friendship and nostalgic memories. It's ironic that Reiner's film looks at the past with such high regards because we can do the same with his filmography. His best films were all made in the 80's (and we can squeeze Misery and A Few Good Men into that list as well although they came out in 1990 and 1992 respectively), and despite not having directed many great films over the past few decades we can still look back at his early films and appreciate his classics. Stand By Me reminds us all of our early childhood and the friendships we made. It doesn't matter what decade we grew up in, we all cherish special memories of adventures we shared with our friends and how they helped shape us. That is what is so universal and appealing about Reiner's film; even though we may never have grown up in a small town or had similar outdoor adventures it still recalls us back to a time where we were discovering new things about the world and standing up for our friends when they were in trouble or running with them when we got caught playing in our neighbor's yards. Stand By Me focuses on these memories and it's not just about the adventure in itself but the bond these friends shared together. It's probably the go to movie when we are comparing or referencing other coming of age films, and in my opinion one of the best ever made considering how much I appreciate the genre. I'm sure the film itself was a life changing experience for many who grew up watching it and dreaming of having similar adventures with their friends.Based on Stephen King's short story, \"The Body,\" the screenplay for the film was adapted by Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans. It takes place in 1959 and centers on four 12 year old friends from Castelrock, Oregon who overhear a conversation about the location of the body of a dead boy who had been missing for several days. The news about the disappearance of this boy had spread all over town, so these kids decide to embark on an adventure through the woods and bring back the missing body so they can be received as heroes. Since the journey would take more than a full day, they plan to tell their parents that they are staying at each other's home. Gordie (Will Wheaton) had recently lost his older brother (played by John Cusack in the flashback scenes) a few months prior to this in a car accident so he knew his mourning parents wouldn't even mind him being gone for a few days. His best friend, Chris (River Phoenix), came from a troublesome family and despite knowing he'd get into trouble if they'd discover his lie he didn't think it would be any different if he stayed with his drunk father. Teddy (Corey Feldman) still has the scars from the abuse he suffered from his mentally unstable father, and currently lives with his mother. Vern (Jerry O'Connell), the clown of the group who isn't taken very seriously is the one who came up with the idea of looking for the body, but he also is the first to back down when it comes to it. The four finally decide to go ahead with their plan and begin their adventure, which will eventually shape who they are. The story is narrated by the grown up version of Gordie (played by Richard Dreyfuss) somewhere around 1985.The strong performances in this film are one of the reasons why it continues to work today. River Phoenix was such a natural and is so charismatic that he steals every scene he's in. The chemistry he shares with Wheaton's character is strong and it reminds us all of that best friend we had in our childhood. Corey Feldman must have had the best agent because he starred in some of the best films that were released in the 80's (Gremlins, The Goonies, The Burbs, and The Lost Boys). Jerry O'Connell is probably the one that has undergone the greatest physical transformation, but he was perfect for the role of Vern and he reminded us of that friend who always seemed to be the butt of every joke. These four young actors carry the film and despite not having the most exciting of adventures, the way the story is told is what makes it such a fascinating one. There are small moments like the one where they gather around the camp fire to listen to Gordie's story, or when they are crossing the pond and discover its full of leeches, that stand out. The film is told through Gordie's recollection of these events and each scene feels like an authentic memory someone would have of such a life changing experience. The 50's soundtrack also plays a key role in the film since it adds to the overall sense of nostalgia. Reiner's film reminds me how much I actually have enjoyed Stephen King's non-horror stories (this along with Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are my favorite film adaptations of his work). Since its 1986 release, all the coming of age films that have followed it seem to heavily borrow from it. Stand By Me is the measuring stick for films in this genre.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

                "As a lover of Stephen King's writing style and Rob Reiner's directing techniques, this movie leaves me speechless every time. It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, \"The Body\" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.First of all, I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. \"Stand By Me\" fits what the characters in the story are facing.  I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to.  All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a \"bad kid.\" And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.To me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.This film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future.",

They decide to find the body to become local heroes and along their journey, they disclose secrets and learn the importance of their friendship.\"Stand by Me\" is another nostalgic little gem from the 80's with a coming-of-age drama, with funny and heartbreaking moments. The plot is simple but realistic and supported by a group of promising young actors. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Conta Comigo\" (\"Count on Me\")",

                "Hands down this is my favorite movie. (With the Sandlot in second place). My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of a movie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can. But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the \"real world\". They find out about a dead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to be famous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the movie reveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all, the boys find out about reality, and how it isn't glamorous. They realize that the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12 and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what you do with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. (Such as the last scene of the movie). This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy.

                "I am as many are, a huge fan of Stephen's King Works. I have also been a fan of many of the films made from his books. Some I am not a fan of. I have not read as of yet and I'm sure I will, The Body. I have seen Stand By Me several times and I am conflicted in many of the great portions of this film and the ideas behind the movie vs the fact that it just doesn't sit with me as entertaining.Stand By Me is considered perhaps one of the forefront coming of age films and for good reason. It's the story of four best friends set in the fifties/sixties told through the eyes of the Gordie Lachance who has lost his role model best friend older brother to an accident. Haunted by the loss of his brother and the fact that everyone seems to have only cared about his older brother including his parents, he is compelled to encourage his group of friends to go on a trek across the county to find the dead body of a missing boy. Unfortunately the \"bad kids\" and \"bullies\" in town also discover that this body is nearby and they race to find it first. During their trek they discover more about each other, and they stand together to overcome their fears about their own lives.I do whole heartedly agree in the pure heart of this film, the coming of age, the different personalities of each boy in the film. It does aim to find a little something of everyone in each boy and it accomplishes that. The cast, especially for young actors is very good. Wil Wheaton as the lead character appears to be weaker than his best friend played by the late River Phoenix but in the end he is really who holds them altogether and overcomes the most of all of them. River Phoenix ironically plays the \"bad boy\" best friend who seems to have very little future but has taken Wheaton's character under his wing and encourages him to make something of himself. Corey Feldman fills in his usual role adequately. Jerry O'Connell as the made fun of \"fat kid\" also plays his role well. Keifer Sutherland who can't help but look like a jerk and an evil fiend also plays well. The cast is basically The Brat Pack and yet for an eighties film it's quite darker than most Brat Pack films. Wholely realistic is the kids' views on life, their fascination with death, cigarettes, adult things, and their adult language. Their trying to be as grown up as possible without any real adult role models.My issue is that the film just doesn't hit me. It never satisfies me or entertains me. I find it entirely too short, very, very, predictable and without any real depth of plot. I know everyone sees this film as a classic and certainly it has it's strong points as I outlined but overall it just falls short for me. The soundtrack, and I absolutely love these songs feels forced like Reiner is trying to force the feeling of the era on us rather than create it all around them. In this case I don't expect anyone to believe my opinion because I am sorely outnumbered but I don't care for this film much at all.5/10",

                "I am 14 years old, and I absolutely love this movie. But don't let my age fool you. I'm not just going to sit here and talk about how hott River Pheonix was.This movie is well rounded in my perspective. Everyone can relate to at least one of the boys in it at one time in their life. The actors are matched perfectly with who their character portrays.Corey Feldman's character Teddy is the boy who's sensitive about his dad, but tries to hide it, Jerry O' Connell's character Vern is the chubby, wussy kid, but still part of the club, Wil Wheaton's character Gordie is the sweet, intelligent friend who tells stories to the other boys and is ignored by his parents, and River Phoenix's character Chris is the boy in the neighborhood that's been labeled a bad kid and feels he'll never get out of their town, the peacemaker, and Gordie's best friend. This movie just sucks you in as soon as you start watching it. It's not overly mushy and sad, but it's not so tough that only a sixteen year old boy could stand it. You feel for each character, no matter how mean or nice they are. My personal favorite is Chris Chambers, which i know this will probably drive you guys nuts that almost every other person does too, but River Phoenix is just so touching. The campfire scene is great, the milk money seen is great, and one of my favorites is the train scene. You can definitely see the terror in their faces. It's funny that they all act so tough, except maybe Vern, although he tries, and they still like talking about goofy and dancing and singing along to Lollipop. You also just want to be there with them. Feel that kind of friendship that so many people long for. It's such a feel good movie, but not in the sense of a 10 year old's feel good movie. It makes you feel complete when you watch it. It's not jam packed with action sequences or it doesn't have fluffy pink bunnies hopping around in it either. It's just one of a kind. Definitely worth my time and yours.The newest DVD of Stand By Me (Special Edition) has Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me where all the main actors,except River, and Rob Reiner are interviewed. They also talk about working with River Phoenix. There's also the Stand By Me music video with River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, and obviously Ben E. King. Not to mention an extra CD with some awesome oldie's songs like Everyday, Lollipop, Stand By Me, and Mr. Lee.",

                "There's a certain irony that one of the most mature films to come from the pen of Stephen King is the one based on a group of kids in the 1950s. Yet this is far from a children's film, instead it's a thoroughly dark coming-of-age drama that explores what it means to be growing up in a realistically downbeat world, as childhood innocence is abandoned in favour of harsh adult reality.It's also a cracking \"gang of kids\" drama, stylistically similar to the likes of THE GOONIES and THE MONSTER SQUAD and even sharing some of the same cast members, albeit with a much more realistic theme. The film is set in 1950s Maine on a hot summer day, where a gang of lads decide to track down the body of a boy hit by a train in return for a reward.In reality it's an excuse for lots of adventures with trains, leeches, and junkyard owners, as well as a nasty antagonist played with gleeful relish by Kiefer Sutherland. There's plenty of crudity here alongside that infamous gross-out pie eating contest, but it's surprisingly mature too with deep characters and genuine performances. River Phoenix is the one who really shines (RIP), but Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell really nail it too. Perhaps the wraparound scenes with Richard Dreyfuss are a little too sentimental, but it's not enough to detract from STAND BY ME being a minor classic of the decade. Great soundtrack too.",

But the story is as much about their pasts and their connection to one another. I just wrote comments on \"The Breakfast Club.\" I felt that movie lacked chemistry. While every type was represented, it just didn't cook the way this one does. Part of it is that these boys, while in some ways disenfranchised, are not open books. As they interact, their dreams and hopes are drawn from them. Some seem quite settled, but when push comes to shove, they have vulnerabilities. The stories they tell give us insight into their souls. From what has happened to some of the actors, it makes one wonder if some of that suffering came from within them. There are intense scenes. There is bragging and one- upsmanship along the way.

                "Stand By Me is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of film ever made in the history of humanity. A truly excellent movie that really strikes and affects you with all its glory. It leaves no one untouched whether you're 12 or 112 years old. Simply because it deals with life and friendship, and all that comes with it. Both the good and the bad.Everyone can relate to it and feel what the characters feel. Because we've all been there. We have all done similar things to what they are doing, we have all been dealing with the same issues in life as they are faced with and we all still are.Few films are able do depict the theme of life and friendship as successfully as Stand By Me. In my opinion there are practically no flaws in this production, everything from the plot and the screenplay to the characters and the actors are top notch. Also the music is great.Watching the movie one feel everything from happiness and laughter to fear and grief. Laughter because we remember how fun it was being a child. With everything being new and exciting in life. And facing it all together with our friends. Fear and grief because of how hard it can be having to grow up and let go of the past. Let go of our old friends and our old life. One can't help but to feel nostalgic. At least I do. It makes me think about life in a larger sense. Thinking about my childhood I realize how long ago it was or at least seems to be. The movie frees a lot of emotions and thoughts regarding both my own life and life in general.This movie also has one of the best opening scenes in film history. I almost burst into tears every time I see it. It's as close to perfection as it gets. It's so beautiful and sad. Simply the perfect way to launch the rest of the movie. How the beautiful soft music first almost reaches out and touch you, while seeing the landscape. Then a close up on the car and the main character reading the chocking news of his dear old friend's death. Thereafter such a smooth passage back to his childhood with focus on the kids passing by on their bikes and the music still in the background. Excellent!To conclude I have also one little flaw, or at least I think of it that way. It's regarding the whole \"Lardass-scence\". When I was little I could never figure out why it was in the film. I couldn't see the connection to the rest of the film. Being older and hopefully a little wiser :D I now see that it's a way of showing Gordies talent for making up stories, the talent that have him becoming a writer one day. However I feel this could have been illustrated in a better way. I've always felt that scene is just a little bit over the top and I still do. Otherwise Stand By Me is close to a masterpiece. No one should go through life without seeing and experiencing this wonderful film.",

                "Stand By Me is probably the best film ever to come from a Stephen King story. (The Green Mile sucks, by the way.) The story is told from an adult writer's point of view as he recounts an adventure he shared with his three best friends in the waning moments of the summer before junior high school began. We see the four boys head out into the wilderness to see the dead body of a boy who was apparently hit by a train. The boys encounter bullies, other trains, leeches, vicious dogs, and many other things on their trip. And they have some pretty deep and emotional conversations along the way.This is a very awkward age in the life of a young man. You can tell by listening to their conversation topics which range from boobs to whether or not Mighty Mouse can beat up Superman. The youngsters are portrayed flawlessly by four terrific young actors. Who would have thunk that Jerry O'Connell would turn out to be the most successful of them? At times they laugh, other times they pick on each other. Sometimes they seem on the verge of fighting, but when challenged by the older gang of bullies, they stick together. Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the adult writer, narrates the action as things move along. Their trip is full of surprises and emotional insight.Stand By Me is not quite a classic in my book, but it is very memorable. The script is a little too pessimistic for my liking. Right down to when River Phoenix describes an incident where he's caught stealing milk money from school, and his teacher ends up keeping it for herself. There is also a complete lack of positive supporting characters during the scenes set back when they were kids. Only John Cusack, in a cameo role, is shown as a positive older character. No wonder these kids felt so unwanted! All the adults around them were jerks! The script uses more swear words than are actually necessary to convey the anger these kids sometimes feel. And you'd think any dead body that had been hit by a train would be more damaged than the one they find out in the woods. Wouldn't this kid have heard the train coming in time and jumped well out of the way? If he was trying to kill himself, then you'd think he would have stood in the way and been completely pulverized. I know these may seem like petty beefs, but they are enough to knock the review down a star or two.It seems like the film is trying to portray the dead Brower boy as the death of these kids' innocence or something to that effect. As someone who's been their age, I can understand some of what they were feeling. And I totally agree that some of the people you thought were your best friends eventually just turn out to be faces in the crowd at school a few years later.Despite it's faults, this is a powerful film you aren't likely to forget. It's one of Reiner's best, and the outstanding cast does some wonderful work themselves.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

                "I was already well beyond my formative pre-teen years when I first saw this film, but there's no denying that if you grew up in small town America, this is about as close as you get to capturing the essence of childhood friendships that remain with you forever, even after time and distance take their eventual toll. Director Rob Reiner skillfully crafts a compelling tale from a Stephen King short story, layering it with various sub-texts that run the gamut from dealing with the town bully to confronting the loss of family. What's probably most remarkable about the picture are the performances that Reiner obtains from his young starring cast, most notably River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, and Wil Wheaton as his best friend Gordie Lachance. Told through the perspective of Wheaton's character, the film conjures up memories of the many trials and tribulations one faces while growing up, often unsure of oneself and even worse, feeling alone and disoriented when personal tragedy strikes and threatens to overwhelm one's very being. Yet the story never gets maudlin or depressing, there's enough youthful camaraderie and mischief on hand to keep the adventurous foursome going strong. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell round out the group, and together they manage to grow and mature in a way that none of them could have imagined prior to starting their quest. Scored with a soundtrack that memorializes some of the great song hits from a half century ago, \"Stand By Me\" is a strange and wonderful journey, in it's own way reminding us of what might have been the best time of our lives.

                "Stand by Me is based on one of my favourite Stephen King stories. It tells about a man remembering his youth in a small town where he and his three friends, all of them twelve and about to embark on different schools, decide to crown their last summer together by taking a trip down the railroad tracks in pursuit of a rumour about a dead body seen by the river. A sight that naturally appeals to the horror freaks in prepubescent boys.It is a quintessential Stephen King story in that the basic premise isn't all that complicated, a couple of lads walking down the tracks, but is filled with insight, purpose and life by the smallest of details given to his characters. I've rarely encountered more interesting, yet so believable characters than I have in his books. He's the one author that has made me realize that every single man or woman alive is interesting beyond belief if you only get to know him or her well enough.Unfortunately the novella is so bountiful and full of details that the movie seems pale by comparison. Most of the important plot points are referenced and acted out, but they don't reach the same emotional impact because details are missing and/or not given enough time to sink in. In addition the film suffers somewhat from the fact that all the main actors are children. They're very good child actors, Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix especially, but you can definitely see through their acting in most scenes.Nevertheless, it's an excellent movie to check out, even if you've read the original novella. It speaks about childhood through very unconventional means, but it rings no less true because of it. Quite the opposite. We really never have friends like the ones we had when we were twelve.",

                "In ancient Greece people watched the great tragedies in the amphi-theatres, and eyewitnesses tell us that audiences of 20'000 sat crying when the main character on the stage became aware of his fatal guilt and had to face death. They called it catharsis, best translated by 'cleaning the souls'. Well, measured by the tremendous effect on all of us writing reviews on the film, STAND BY ME has the power and qualities of ancient tragedy. This jewel of a film touches and shakes the best sides in us. I have watched it over and over again, and even if I watch it several times a week I still sit and laugh and cry, and it leaves me sad and confused and grateful, feelings that can last for hours and sometimes days.So what is the mystery behind this masterpiece?First of all it teaches us that good filmmaking isn't about the dollars spent on the production, but about the people who make it.And it's about a unique and humble (I hope you understand what I mean) director: Rob Reiner doesn't try to show how good he is, leering at the Oscar-jury:the story is told without any visual effects, the pace is slow and the cinematography is unspectacular, but he succeeds in inspiring his young actors to perform honest feelings and letting the story develop by its own terms. An example is the milkmoney-scene. It is told that Reiner wasn't satisfied with the performance of River Phoenix. They tried again and again. Finally, he told River to remember a situation of his own life where a grownup had let him down. Guess if he succeeded with it! River Phoenix started crying and he couldn't stop crying a long time after the shot was taken. That's why this film is pure gold: it doesn't show professional acting, it shows young boys who open their hearts in front of a camera. They can do it, because they can relate to similar experiences and because the message is important and universal. We all can relate to similar situations. These scenes make me remember events from my own youth that I had inhibited for a long time, because I didn't like to remember them. That's the pain!But it's not only the director and the actors who should earn all the credits. I read the novel after watching the film, and since that time Stephen King is one of the great contemporary writers in my book. I just don't understand why he doesn't write more of THE BODY kind. To me this book is pure poetry (including all those four-letter-words that Maltin e. a. don't like, because they don't understand why they are necessary)! But the most amazing thing is: the script doesn't only catch the quintessence of the novel, it's partly even better! This perfect balance between humor and seriousness! It doesn't manipulate the audience. In the book grownup Gordon sits in his car when he had read about his friend's death. \"I drove out of town, parked, and cried for him. Cried for damn near half an hour, I guess.\" In the film Gordon doesn't cry. He doesn't need to. Everyone in the audience feels like crying, because they understand the tragedy! There are only 13 pages of dialogue and narration, and there really is not one line too much. It's so good, I almost know the whole of it by heart. Take the ending: In the book, the famous writer Gordon Lachance tells about how he met Ace Merrill again, some twenty years after the Ray Brower event: grown fat and the only one alive of his old friends and enemies. How much better is the film's ending! This important line about the friends we had when we were twelve years old is only a line in King's book, commending the good time the boys have at Milo Pressman's junkyard! If there had been an Oscar for impressive film endings, this film had deserved the first!And thank you Jack Nitzsche for the intense score. It's Gordie's theme, when he's not with his friends. In the group Gordie is the smart boy with the sharp, quick, fresh replies. Without the friends, at home or in the store he barely speaks a word. And then we can hear that fragile Jack Nitzsche variation on Stand by me. It's like Gordie crying `where are you, Chris? Come, stand by me'. That's brilliant and exactly what great filmmusic should be: serving the film's dramaturgy.Well, I don't know how many hours it took me to express my love to this film in a language that isn't my own. It seems impossible. It is exactly as Stephen King expressed it himself (end of chapter 29): `Even if I'd known the right thing to say, I probably couldn't have said it. Speech destroys the functions of love, I think - that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say, I guess, but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm, it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth; they bite; the wounds never close. No word, no combination of words, can close those lovebites. It's the other way around, that's the joke. If those wounds dry up, the words die with them. Take it from me. I've made my life from the words, and I know that is so.'10 out of 10, no doubt about it!",

                "Stand by Me (1986) **** (out of 4) Coming of age film about four friends (Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell) who set out to find the body of a missing teen. For my money this is the best coming of age film ever made because of how real it comes off. Perhaps I see myself and my friends in the role of these characters when we were their age but the movie has always struck me as being as true to teenage years as a film can possibly get. The bad language, the stuff the boys talk about and their looking for adventure is something any guy can connect with and I think this film delivers all the laughs, tears and drama of growing up.Each of the four boys are given great character development over the course of the 88-minute running time, which is pretty remarkable since the film doesn't run too long. We get to know each of the characters from their fears to their hopes for the future even though it's obvious that some won't ever reach their goals, which again, just falls back on how real the movie comes off. This is certainly one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story and director Reiner handles all of it with great care and his visual style and song selections all hit the right mark. Another thing that keeps the film great are the performances by the four leads. Wheaton, Feldman and O'Connell all have some very tough scenes for such young actors but all pull them off without any trouble. The film belongs to Phoenix however as he clearly sticks out from the rest of the cast, which is saying a whole lot. The maturity he shows here is rather amazing to watch because there are actors twice his age that wouldn't be able to pull off the material here. The way the four boys work together makes their characters very memorable. The supporting players include future stars Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack who also turn in great performances. Richard Dreyfuss appears in a few scenes and narrates the film and he does a great job. I think narration quite often ruins films but that's not the case here because Dreyfuss really puts his heart and soul into the narration and it really comes off as he's telling a story from his own childhood.",
